This test turned out to be a blessing in disguise for schools that caught a glimpse of the opportunity for innovation.\n\nThe Lyc?e Saint Riquier took up the challenge and chose Acer Chromebook to revolutionize teaching, adapting to the emergency and finding a new perspective on education more focused on individualized learning in the meantime.\n\n\nLyc?e Saint Riquier: education striving for success \n\nThe Lyc?e Saint Riquier is a school located in Amiens that accommodates around 1700 students from kindergarten to senior year. \n\nThe school is founded on three core educational principles: providing a robust education, developing effective study methods, and assisting as many individuals as possible in achieving their goals. Each year, the school??s educational team operates with these goals in mind.\n\nAccording to the school??s statement, at Lyc?e_ Saint Riquier the focus is on highlighting the potential of the young generation, providing solid educational values to project them into a bright future. \n\n\nAcer Chromebooks transforming an emergency into an opportunity \n\nThe COVID pandemic forced the Lyc?e Saint Riquier, like most schools, to close its premises. However, teaching could not stop, so the school decided to find a solution, and Acer Chromebooks entered the game, transforming teaching and learning forever. \n\nThis is the origin story of what Lyc?e Saint Riquier calls flexible classes: special classes where teachers adapt to students?? needs to allow them to follow their learning pace. In this context, Acer Chromebooks are essential in this individualized learning strategy because they host the students?? personalised plans that they can follow according to their schedule and pace.\n\n\nChoosing Acer Chromebooks for school: all the reasons why\n\nAccording to the school??s IT manager, Flavien Namont, there are many reasons to choose an Acer Chromebook for classroom activities. First, the devices are simple to use, quick to turn on, and update automatically, limiting time wastage.\n\nFurthermore, their 12 hours of autonomy and ruggedized design make them adaptable to survive an entire school day in the often indelicate hands of students. Additionally, the control interface enables Mr Namont to handle all devices through a single button.\n\n\nAcer ?V we enjoyed working with them a few years ago for PCs and for extended warranties that other brands don??t offer, so we thought: why not renew the experience with the Chromebook? ?V Flavien Namont, IT Manager\n\nThe Lyc?e Saint Riquier proceeded to set up 35 racks to store the devices. Teachers who need them for their classes can book them and move the racks directly into the classroom so that each student can work with their own Acer Chromebook, logging in with their personal account.\n\nBy using these Chromebooks, we transformed the way we teach, offering a richer teaching experience adapted to today??s students and their needs. ?V Karine Shuler, French Professor\n\nOverall, as the school??s staff witness, a further advantage of introducing the devices is that students can get used to interacting with technology in their everyday lives.\n\n\nSuccess Story Key Info\nSchool name: Lyc?e Saint Riquier\nAcer devices: Acer Chromebook\nInfo: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com '),

When the staff decided to integrate technology and digital tools for schools into its curriculum, the natural choice was Acer Chromebooks. Let??s explore the reasons why!\n\n\nGet to know New English School Kuwait\n\nSince 1969, when Mr. Tareq Rajab and his wife, Jihan Rajab, founded New English School Kuwait, this institution has consistently focused on fostering academic excellence through various opportunities for students.\n\nThe school has a significant historical background, initiated by its first chairman, Tareq Rajab, who came from a family of pioneers in education. In a time of great change in Kuwait, he foresaw the need to introduce English education within the country.\n\nToday, the Rajab family still manages New English School Kuwait. The institution caters to 2,200 students from kindergarten to A level, offering a British-style curriculum. Of the 2,200 students, about 1,650 currently use Acer Chromebooks for homework and classroom tasks.\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks: from school staff to students, benefits for all\n\nChoosing Acer Chromebooks has brought numerous benefits to New English School Kuwait, extending beyond just the students. The school principal, Richard Marchant, highlights that the first improvement area was administration. Indeed, the new devices significantly enhanced collaboration, leading to better planning of future activities.\n\nThe school staff utilizes various digital tools such as apps and extensions to enrich classroom provisions and ensure continuous professional development. However, teachers are the ones who truly benefit from Acer Chromebooks and their features.\n\n\n??The best thing about using an Acer Chromebook is that it helps me stay completely on top of all my work and organize. There are lots of organizational apps that I can use on there, like Google Calendar, keeping me on top of my work, especially while I??m juggling my A-levels and all the extracurriculars going on.?? Judy Hegazy ?V Year 13\n\n\nMoreover, educators can enhance their teaching methods and planning by providing students with high-quality apps and extensions. For example, they can share materials with students before class, enabling pre-learning and lightening their load. This way, students arrive prepared and ready to engage in the lesson.\n\nHowever, the digital tools revolutionized classroom activities as well. The school staff witnessed how using apps like Google Slides allowed students to practice presentations. Instead, they introduced AI to assess students?? writing and character description skills.  \n\nIn essence, Acer Chromebooks brought New English School Kuwait better school and classroom management for the staff and improved independence in the learning process for students.   \n\n\nFurthering the commitment to sustainability with Acer Chromebooks\n\nNew English School Kuwait is an institution dedicated to promoting international ecological awareness and sustainability. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the sustainable features of Acer Chromebooks captured the school??s attention, playing a crucial role in the selection of these devices.\n\nAs mentioned by its Principal, the ideal device for New English School Kuwait must adhere to precise ecological standards, encompassing sustainable sourcing of materials, recyclable packaging, and peripherals.\n\nIn alignment with the school??s commitment to creating a sustainable community, Acer Chromebooks were identified as a reassuring reflection of this shared dedication.\n\nAs schools around the globe continue to share their success stories with Acer Chromebooks, it is fascinating to see how each one finds unique advantages that align with their individual needs and educational values. This flexibility can only be ensured by devices designed with a deep understanding of education, where the ultimate goal is to innovate the sector.\n\n\nSuccess Story Key Info\nSchool name: New English School Kuwait\nAcer devices: Acer Chromebook\nInfo: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com'),

He teaches technology to middle school students. In addition to his teaching job, he is a part-time trainer at the school??s training centre for nursery assistants and care assistants. At the same time, he is the Google Administrator for his school and manages approximately 1,500 accounts.\n\nMarc Bonnin has been teaching for over 30 years, and for 16 years was the IT Manager at College La Chaume La Salle in Vouill?, France. His in-depth knowledge of new technologies and IT gives him a hands-on experience of how hardware and software can be used in the classroom, as well as the educational benefits to be gained by students, teachers and interns. \n\n\nMarc Bonnin chooses the Acer Chromebook and Google applications.\n\nMr. Bonnin was a Mac and then a PC user under Windows environment. He switched his working environment when he started using Google Workspace Education and realized that he could do all his teaching work from a Chromebook. He bought his first Acer Chromebook in 2015 to help write his lectures and make it easier to post them online, using Google??s tools. At home, he uses a 14-inch Acer Chromebook (CB5-312T) and for going to school, he takes a second, smaller 11-inch Acer Chromebook (CB R751-TN), which he considers to be more portable and resistant. These are his daily work tools. Mr. Bonnin has chosen convertible and touch formats with a stylus because he finds them practical to use, particularly for note-taking.\n\n??I took a look at all the tools I was using and when I got my hands on the Chromebook I said to myself that I should switch over because I could just use one solution. I??m very pleased with this solution because every day I can see the benefits of these tools and the convenience of sharing content across multiple devices. Everything becomes simpler and easier?? said M. Bonnin.\n\nThe benefits of this solution is not limited to hardware and applications. It also provides IT departments the ability to manage the entire network. In Marc Bonnin??s case, it means he can easily manage 1,500 accounts remotely from a single Chromebook, controlling the entire school??s network from the Google Admin console.\n\nMr. Bonnin also believes that the Chromebook is a durable and stable solution. ??What??s great about the Acer Chromebooks is that they can last a long time with automatic updates. I haven??t noticed any latency or technological obsolescence; they perform just like they did on the first day. This means we can extend the lifespan of our equipment, which is better for the environment and our bottom line?? he added.\n\nOn his Acer Chromebooks, Mr Bonnin most often uses applications from the Google Workspace suite: Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Sites, as well as Lego EV3 Classroom for programming LEGO robots, and Sketchup for Schools for 3D drawing.\n\nAll his courses are organized in Google Drive and published in Google Sites. He illustrates his lessons with educational content from Lumni.com, videos from the Arte TV channel and other sites he finds relevant. He shares them easily on the Google Site he created which he has been adding to and updating for several years now.\n\n\nChromebook, the right solution for teachers and training classes\n\nMr. Bonnin is convinced that the computer is an essential element in learning, teaching and training today. He has noticed that young children find it much easier to pick up and use. ??They are born with the technology in their hands and their minds adapt remarkably well to it.?? He adds. ??For adults who are not used to working with digital technology in their daily lives, such as teachers or people in training courses, the Chrome environment is perfect: simple, easy and intuitive.?? And for those who are technology-averse and think it is an inaccessible world, Mr Bonnin notes that ??if you take the time to explain how it works, the Chrome suite makes it easy to adapt.??\n\nFor students with disabilities, Mr Bonnin is convinced that the Chromebook is a solution that is adapted to their needs. Google??s philosophy is to keep the same logic from one generation to the next, which is a major advantage and saves time when it comes to training.\n\n\nWhen you enter the world of Chromebook, the user interface is identical in all the applications, which makes it easier to learn and to use the entire suite of products. This way all that is left to do is concentrate on the educational and creative processes, which is the very essence of teaching. ?V Marc Bonnin\n\n\nToday it??s also about training people in adopting good digital practices, having the right reflexes, while remaining vigilant. ??The teacher is no longer the one who holds all the knowledge. Students are inundated with information, whether on platforms or social networks. No matter what subject I??m teaching, I train students on how to carry out research, find information and cross-reference sources. I teach them to have rigour when using IT tools, manipulating data and to adopt good practices. Questionable information found on social networks can take on a life of its own and become a reality for some people, which is why it??s vital to talk about it.? details M. Bonnin.\n\nThe Chromebook is easy to manage and very powerful for daily tasks.  The ChromeOS environment allows to find all documents on any device with just one password. Mr Bonnin??s school has chosen to keep all the computers secured at school, but students can use their Google Edu Chrome account to find at home all their content on their various devices, such as smartphones, tablets or computers.\n\nAs an introduction, Mr Bonnin always starts by talking about the importance of data security, whether to his secondary school pupils or during adult education training courses. He raises awareness of the risk of losing documents and of the dangers that can arise from certain vulnerable devices such as USB sticks or external hard drives. With a Chromebook and a Google Chrome account, security is reinforced.\n\nEach student has their own Google Edu user code and password as soon as they enter the school. ??It??s very easy to reset accounts if they lose their password. But it??s quite rare. I also explain to them how to reconnect at home so that they can continue with their project,?? he adds.\n\nAs part of his teaching, Mr Bonnin runs the small business project, which is managed by the French association ?? Entrepreneurship for Learning ??. The aim of this project is to simulate the creation of a company by putting together its organization, services and products. For example, 8th graders have to identify the departments and their roles (CEO, production worker, financial director, HR director, etc.). To facilitate collaboration between students, they use Google tools. In the Drive, Mr. Bonnin has created a shared space organized by department, just as a company would do, in order to integrate the different content and creations of the students. This encourages collaboration between students and gives a global view of the progress of the business creation. A discussion space has also been created in Gmail to keep the project moving forward, even outside school hours.\n\nHe trains teachers who wish to do so on the same tools: managing their email account, their drive, using the word processor spreadsheet, slide presentation, how to convert their Word documents into Google docs, for example. ??At the request of a vocational baccalaureate colleague, I provided training on using Google site so that her students could present a portfolio of works (a progression of a certain number of projects) to a panel of judges. This enabled them to learn how to manage documents and present them in the form of a website,?? he adds.\n\nAs part of the training centre, Mr Bonnin teaches nursery assistants and care assistants aged 19 to 50. The objective is to teach them certain digital concepts using the tools in the Google Workspace suite. The Chrome environment is ideal for quickly and easily learning how to manage emails and documents in Drive, how to export to PDF and store files, how to write and edit letters, and how to insert photos into a Google Docs document to create a resume, for example.\n\n\n\nThe right training solution for tomorrow??s tools\n\nAccording to Marc Bonnin, teaching middle and high school students about the digital world, managing a Chromebook and the Chrome environment, all contribute to preparing them to use tomorrow??s tools. Students will need to use these tools later in their working lives, and this is already helping them to adapt to their future working lives.\n\nThe Chromebook is the solution that makes it easy to combine theory and practice. He describes the Chromebook as fast, versatile and easy to use. He concludes by saying ??I??ve also converted my family and friends to the Chromebook to simplify their daily tasks. It??s so practical and easy that I??m trying to share this information with as many people as possible.?? \n\nDid this Acer Chromebook experience spark your curiosity? \nContact us today to digitalise your school with Acer devices: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com'),

To maximize student involvement in the learning process.\n\nAdditionally, the obsolete and inefficient old ICT equipment needed a replacement that could suit the needs of modern education, becoming a beneficial learning tool for students while supporting teachers?? everyday activities.\n\nLooking to exploit this double-win situation, the Masaryk Gymnasium partnered with Acer and became one of the first educational institutions in the Czech Republic to adopt Google technologies.\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks: matching every requirement\n\nMasaryk found that Acer devices were the ideal choice due to their school-focused design.\n\nWhen selecting new ICT for the school, it was crucial to consider specific requirements. The devices must be durable enough to withstand daily use and user-friendly to simplify workload management.\n\nAdditionally, affordability and the protection of student and teacher data were also a priority. Ultimately, the right solution had to be both safe and economical to purchase and maintain.\n\nReferrals from other schools helped the Masaryk Gymnasium zero in on Acer as their partner for integrating information technology into the learning experience. Upon reception of these valuable references, the school cooperated with the Czech branch of the Google User Group to select the most fitting devices.\n\nAfter pilot testing, the Masaryk Grammar School introduced to its classrooms the durable Acer Chromebook Spin 512. Its long battery life, 12-inch touchscreen and convertible, rugged design included the Chrome Education Upgrade and proved the perfect solution for every level of learning and teaching!\n\n\n??Acer Chromebooks have proven to be the right choice for introducing digital technologies into the classroom. Their acceptance by both students and teachers has been smooth, and they are now used in all areas of education, including leisure activities.??\nPavel Kerekes, Masaryk Grammar School principal\n\n\nFurthermore, students are the first happy witnesses of the success of introducing Chromebooks in the learning process. The devices are both easy to use and designed to support education thanks to the inclusion of features such as the Google Workspace for Education services which assist students in individual and group work.\n\n\nSuccess Story Key Info:\nSchool name: Masaryk Grammar School\nAcer devices: Chromebook Spin 512\nInfo: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com'),

In response to that question, the first German universities are revisiting their approach to exams with more than 50 participants using the Acer Chromebook 514.\n\nWhile ensuring security and compatibility with low technical effort might sound challenging on paper, the experiment proved very successful! Read on for details of the digitization strategy test in Germany.\n\n\nWhat are e-exams?\n\nShort for electronic exams, e-exams replace traditional one-to-one in-paper examinations. They typically take place in a PC room, making exam assessment seamless and time-saving. Advantages include the automatic correction of closed questions and improved speed, quality and objectivity in evaluation.\n\nMoreover, e-exams also simplify the correction of partially open questions and provide better readability. Plus, the integration of media ?V such as photos or videos. In terms of organisation, e-exams can automatically assign different versions of the examinations to student groups and organise questions in pools.\n\n\nDigitization & Acer Chromebooks: setup times for exam rooms\n\nHundreds of Acer Chromebook 514 devices with Wi-Fi 6, organized into Leba notebook carts of 32 devices each and a complete WLAN infrastructure including access points and server. This technical setup was the departure point of a large German university that tested the exam-digitization process over the past few months.\n\nThe university team transported the equipment by van to the respective examination rooms and set up a complete WLAN infrastructure. Setup time for each exam room took approximately 1.5 hours. \n\nChromebooks boot up and connect to the internet in just a few seconds. After establishing a connection, a browser window giving access to the exam server appears. After logging in with their university access, students receive their exams, and the timer starts.\n\nThis solution uses managed Google Guest sessions which is essential for data protection. No Google log-in is needed.\n\nExam data is stored only on university servers via a locked, internal Wi-Fi 6 network ?V hence no personal data is transferred via the browser to Google and to the Google Cloud.\n\nMoreover, devices are easily charged via the Leba notebook carts. The Chromebook??s 10-hour battery life is an excellent feature, allowing no interruption during long exams. \n\n\nSuccessful digitization with simple administration\n\nTo create a defined environment, devices are configured so that students cannot access the Internet during a digital exam ?V providing a simple solution to a problem administrators have faced for over a decade. \n\nWhen the managed guest session is in kiosk mode, students can only use the learning application released by the administrator, so they cannot search answers online. \n\nWith Chromebooks, the German University found the perfect solution: ??For us, management has to be totally simple,?? remarked its technical officer.\n\n??Another difficulty in switching to digital exams, or electronic assessments, is getting the exam questions right?? ?V as university experts well know. As university operations are generally contact-restricted or completely virtual, instructors have compiled huge question pools from which they simply ??drag and drop?? into exams. Currently, the ILIAS learning platform ?V an open-source solution for universities and schools ?V stores 1,500 e-exams!\n\n\nZero Touch Enrollment & the Chrome Education Upgrade\n\nThanks to Chrome Education Upgrade, digitization gets even easier with Acer Chromebook and Zero Touch Enrollment.\n\nWhat is Zero Touch Enrollment? Above all, it??s easy! The administrator simply creates a token in the Admin Console with the configuration information. This is a one-time effort that??s identical for all devices. Then, The token is assigned to the devices via a serial number ?V a process that Acer Education Solution Centers take care of ??behind the scenes?? together with Acer as certified Google Pre-Provisioning Partners.\n\n\n??It??s a matter of a few hours, and it minimizes the effort for the administrators at the customer??s site.??\nDirk Weltermann, Project Supervisor, Acer.\n\n\nE-exams reception\n\nThe e-exams were well received by professors and students alike ?V both in-person and virtually on Acer Chromebooks. For lecturers, evaluation required significantly less effort. Even with text-based exams, they save a third of the time spent correcting handwritten papers. Plus, automated procedures such as multiple choice or additions provide further streamlining.\n\nThere are also new ways of testing. For instance, students can zoom in on X-ray images and even listen to assignments or explanations. Formative, summative, as well as diagnostic exams are easy to map. Clearly, the advantages of e-assessment are vast.\n\n??Students feel the computers treat them fairly?? ?V university officials noted. ??They appreciate receiving results promptly and use the opportunity to practice on real exams in advance on the platform.?? The cumulative result has been a positive development in grade averages. \n\nThis expressly favourable outcome is likely to accelerate the university digitization of education significantly.\n\n\nMake the best of Acer Chromebooks and Chrome Education Upgrade\nInspired by this case study?

As a matter of fact, students often struggle to find employment in their field of study. \n\nBeacuse transitioning from university to work can be daunting at times, with this Hackathon, we renew our commitment to bridging the gap between university and industry, offering students the opportunity to experience a professional challenge first-hand.\n\n\nThree concepts, one goal\n\nWe challenged Laurea students ?V organised in groups ?V to develop a social media plan for Acer based on real-life cases. We selected three significant educational topics for our brand: sustainability, creativity, and skill development. \n\nIn the first case, ??Make your green mark??, students were requested to create a comprehensive social media campaign focusing on Acer??s efforts in becoming a sustainable company, engaging a younger target audience.\n\nThe second option was centred on ConceptD ?V Acer??s line for developers and creators. With ??Let creators be creators??, we asked our applicants to design a campaign to promote ConceptD as the ideal companion for creative tasks for students and young adults.\n\nThe third pick starred our Chromebook portfolio. We challenged students to create a digital campaign on the importance of 21st Century skills in today??s world. And, most importantly, on how Acer Chromebooks can help learners foster their digital skillsets. \n\nEach team could choose only one of these options. On the one hand, we asked them to let their creativity free and present the most innovative ideas. On the other hand, we reminded them to focus on Acer??s needs, scope, target audience, and budget. \n\nOnly the most comprehensive and engaging presentations would win!\n\n\nHere are the winners of the first Acer Hackathon \n\nA jury of Acer for Education EMEA professionals evaluated all the projects. On April 1st, we asked the groups to present their works during an online meeting. \n\nBoth Laurea??s teachers and Acer were impressed with the students?? professionalism. All projects were content-rich and featured a comprehensive approach in most cases. It??s been a tough ride choosing the winners! But ultimately, two projects stood out from the rest. \n\nFirstly, the team of Nita, Oona, Elina, Anni, and Marika presented a ConceptD project called ??Creativity Belongs to everyone??: a four-week creative challenge launched on four different channels, targeting different creator segments. The jury praised the candidates for the overall concept, structure and multichannel approach.\n\nAs for the second winning team, Isidora, Julia, Huong, Ajaan, and Caroline focused on ConceptD too. Their ??Acer Challenges?? engaged students from 3AMK in Finland and beyond to create and submit ConceptD-themed patches. Their out-of-the-box approach and original storyboards designed by the students themselves secured them a winning spot.\n\n\nMore brilliant submissions from the Acer Hackathon\n\nAs regards the sustainability topic, two teams caught the jury??s attention. Firstly, Tommi, Riina, Osman, Susanna and Pauline??s ??#Acergreenmark?? proposed asking Acer??s audience to record a 10-second ??green action?? video. Secondly, the ??#acercares project?? by Ahmed, Hans, Gresa, Gessila, Anas and Ty matched an educational and informative approach.\n\nMoreover, ConceptD projects included the awareness-based proposal by Jarkko, Tarmo, Verneri and Markus and ??Exceed your limits?? by Anniina, Elina, Henna, Ida and Saara, which focused on the Nordic countries. Finally, Petteri, Markus, Laura, Jere and Matti??s ??Creator of the year?? introduced a yearly creative contest.\n\nLastly, the most inspiring Chromebook submission came from Anni, Liisa, Riina, Iina and Miro, with a concept based on influencer marketing to inform, engage and build awareness. \n\nWe want to thank all the Acer Hackathon participants and Laurea??s teachers for teaming up with us for this inspiring initiative.

The Acer TravelMate B3 has been a great learning companion for Danesfield??s students, especially during online learning. All children could use their own devices at home and do their lessons remotely during the lockdown. \n\nAs schools are returning to in-person learning, the TravelMate B3 notebooks came back to physical classrooms alongside pupils. Teachers particularly enjoy how durable they are, on the inside and the outside. Their battery life can go through a full school day, and their designs are built-to-last. What??s more, they are small in size (only 11.6?) and really lightweight, therefore, easy to move from room to room.\n\nWith less time needed for configuration and fast boot times, Danesfield teachers can focus on letting the creativity run wild with no downtime. That goes along with Windows 11 SE??s cloud-based environment, which enables quick sign in and access to online resources without downloading apps. \n\nTeaching-wise, educators enjoy using Acer devices paired with Windows 11 SE because they can give students instant feedback as they turn in assignments or monitor progress. That makes it easier for teachers to help students understand topics or provide real-time support.\n\nWhat??s best, by running Office 365, Minecraft Education Edition, Flipgrid and Microsoft Forms on students?? notebooks, Danesfield??s educators have enhanced the learning process and unlocked an engaging way to help children build fundamental 21st century skills.\n\n\nAcer??s role in Danesfiled??s digital transformation\n\n??It??s so important to have a digital strategy to ensure everybody knows the vision of what you??re trying to achieve,?? says Sarah Morgan, Danesfield School??s Headteacher.\n\n??Acer enables you to do that because it enables you to have a school-size budget and still keep developing. And that??s where the STEM Rewards program really supports that.?? she continues. ??It means we can ensure that the teachers have that level of confidence, have a growth mindset to keep trying, to keep challenging themselves.??\n\nThanks to Acer devices, Danesfield successfully became the first European school to roll out Windows 11 SE, the new Windows edition designed explicitly for education. Its effectiveness on cost-effective devices allowed the school to switch to a simpler, cloud-based, distraction-free environment.\n\n\nSuccess Story Key Info\nSchool name: Danesfield School, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, UK\nAcer devices: TravelMate B3\nReseller contact: EAC Network Solutions\n\n\nWould you like to start your first digital transformation project? \nContact our team.

The pandemic saw kitchen tables turned into online classrooms overnight in homes around the world. Remote learning exposed inequalities among pupils, not in ability but in access to the latest technology.\n\nTo tackle this issue at the Cirrus Primary Academy Trust, we embarked on a digital transformation journey with Joskos with the aim of giving all students equal access to learning. \n\nCirrus MAT includes five schools from South West London. As part of their program to improve learning outcomes and increase collaboration between the schools during remote learning, we teamed up with Joskos to deliver 750 Acer devices to pupils in key year groups. \n\n\nDriving digital transformation in K-12 with Acer TravelMate B3\n\nCirrus MAT was looking for durable devices that could fit the needs of primary school students. Moreover, the trust needed a reliable, cost-effective solution that could retain online software upgrades for the future. Ultimately, the choice fell on Acer TravelMate B3. \n\nFirst of all, the 11.6? display made TravelMate B3 the best option in terms of size, as it perfectly fits any student??s backpack. Secondly, teachers and parents could avoid worrying about accidental falls, bumps or liquid spills. The ruggedized, durable design certified by Military Standard durability particularly suits younger students. The same goes for the mechanically anchored keys and spill-proof keyboard, a great combination to elevate the device??s durability. \n\nFurthermore, durability is also mirrored in terms of battery life. In fact, students can use the device throughout a whole school day with a single charge. And if by any chance they need a power-up, they can rely on the quick recharge.\n\nAdditionally, Acer TravelMate B3 also boasts fast connectivity for both classroom and remote learning. In other words, learning can happen anywhere with no slow-downs. Last but not least, the great compatibility with Microsoft 365 for Education made this notebook a perfect choice to make the most of Microsoft Office, Teams and more.\n\n\nTeaming up with Joskos\n\nThe school tech upgrade was supported by Joskos?? total commitment. They helped the schools implement effective change management by ensuring all devices were student-ready after unboxing. As a result, pupils could immediately benefit from online learning during the pandemic. \n\nWhat??s more, Joskos helped the trust with step-by-step guides for parents and students, training for teachers, a digital champion program and constant IT support.

Their students?? laptops became slow, their battery life decreased, they were constantly bugged with updates and long boot times. Not to mention IT assistance, which became too frequent and expensive. A major change was needed. They were looking for a solution that could meet the needs of students, teachers and principals, and found a reliable answer in Acer Chromebook.\n\nRanders?? teachers were particularly happy with this choice, because thanks to this upgrade, they could finally focus their attention on making a difference in the classroom rather than struggling with downtime and IT support. In the words of one of the school??s educators: \n\n??The best thing about Acer Chromebooks is that it is the device that provides the most time for teaching and takes up the least space in terms of technology and support.??\n\nThanks to their long-lasting battery life, enhanced performance and elevated connectivity, Acer Chromebook Spin 713 made the perfect device to last through the most intense school days and teach effortlessly empowered by online resources. Plus, Acer Chromebook??s intuitive Chrome OS made digital learning easy for both tech-savvy teachers and also less experienced ones.\n\nOn the other hand, the young students of the school loved their new learning companions as well. Beyond their eye-catching design, their Acer Chromebook Spin 512 conquered them with the convertible design, that, together with the touch display, made their experience at school even more interactive and enjoyable.\n\n\nTaking learning further with Acer Chromebook \n\nTeachers from Randers?? School listed several reasons why their students enjoy their new Chromebooks so much.\n\nFor starters, unlike regular 16:9 displays, the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 offers more vertical screen space to read and visualise information, thanks to its 3:2 aspect ratio. That means less scrolling and time to focus! Its 12?? display makes it a perfect fit for students?? backpacks while also saving space on the school desk to work along with notes and books. Plus, the versatile design of the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 allows students to learn and collaborate in different screen options, including clamshell, tablet, display and tent mode. \n\nMoreover, kids being kids, things can get a little messy in the classroom at times. But that won??t be an issue: Acer Chromebook Spin 512 stands up to daily wear and tear thanks to its Military Standard durability and Corning Gorilla Glass. Its reinforced design protects the device from liquids on the keyboards and bumpers. Accidental falls or spills will no longer be a concern. On the other hand, durability is also reflected by the device??s long battery life. In fact, one charge is enough to get the students throughout the entire school day.\n\nAs mentioned above, teachers love most about the devices?? speed and connectivity. Acer Chromebook Spin 512??s fast boot time gets students learning quicker, and the simplified interface makes the Chromebooks easy to use, even for younger pupils. Acer Chromebook Spin 713, powered by Google for Education and Google Play? apps, also stood by the side of Randers?? teachers during the remote learning period: \n\n??We have been shut down for a short period of time, and we have been using them for online teaching. [?K] We??ve become very keen on sharing documents on Google Classroom.??\n\nLast but not least, let??s not forget about security. Both Chromebooks come with built-in malware protection against online threats right out of the box. In other words, school and students?? data are always protected and safe.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about our success story from Denmark.\n\n\nSuccess Story Key Info\nSchool name: Oust M?lleskolen & Hobrovejens Skole, Randers Municipality, Denmark \nAcer devices: Chromebook Spin 512 ?V Chromebook Spin 713 \nReseller contact: Comm2IG ?V pb@comm2ig.dk\nDo you want to upgrade your school devices to Acer Chromebook just like the Randers Municipality did?

While the socio-economic and cultural level of their families is considerably diversified.  16% of the school population is represented by foreign learners, most of those from Albania, Morocco, Pakistan and China. Moreover, in the 2020/21 school year there were a total of 75 students with SEN (Special Education Needs) enrolled.\n\nWhile only a limited number of pupils could access laboratories due to availability issues, teachers needed to implement digital education through a solution suitable for all students. This is where Acer TravelMate and Microsoft Office 365 Education came into play.\n\nAs a matter of fact, EdTech represented the turning point to address the needs of the Bartolomeo Sestini students. It supported teachers and students during times of distance learning and remained a staple when classes could be finally held in person once again. \n\n\nElevating digital learning with Acer Notebook & Office 365 Education\n\nAcer TravelMate Spin B3 felt like a natural choice to implement digital learning in the school for multiple reasons. Firstly, the notebooks?? batteries are durable and last for most of the school day. Secondly, the convertible design of the TravelMate Spin B3 offers several opportunities in terms of collaboration, note-taking and flexibility, as students can use the devices in both tablet or notebook mode according to different situations. In addition, the notebooks come with a dockable pen, which allows students to unleash their creativity with drawing and graphic works. Finally, thanks to their lightweight and 11.6?? display, the devices are easy to handle, fit inside backpacks smoothly and are suitable for use in various environments and surfaces, from outdoor to classroom desks.\n\nMost importantly, the devices also accompanied students?? activities at home during remote learning. As a matter of fact, families could borrow the devices from the school and keep them as long as they needed them. \n\n\nAcer TravelMate & Office 365 Education: the perfect match\n\nOffice 365 Education completed the learning experience at the Bartolomeo Sestini, matching the deployment of the devices and offering the tools the school needed to carry on its activities from home or in the classroom. While OneDrive was already implemented for planning and sharing documents, during the pandemic students made the best out of other Microsoft Office apps, such as Teams, OneNote and Forms, thus elevating individual and collaborative activities remotely.\n\nAs remarked by one of the school??s teachers, Acer TravelMate and Office 365 Education ??have been very useful and versatile to allow the implementation of innovative digital teaching as with their characteristics it is easy to use them daily in the classes and other spaces of the Institute. They enable the use of Office 365, Teams, and all connected apps, in a functional and simple way.??\n\nWhat??s best, the devices also helped to fuel collaboration among the teaching staff. In fact, senior and experienced teachers trained less-skilled and junior colleagues on the use of Office 365 Education. By doing so, they made sure everyone could keep up with their teaching programs during the pandemic.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about this success story from Italy.

Some schools learnt how to make the best out of that situation and fully embraced the possibilities offered by hybrid learning, considering this model a pillar for the school of tomorrow.\n\n\nMeet the students and teachers from Star International School\n\nNeal Oates, Vice Principal of Star International School Mirdif, is one of those educators who firmly believe that hybrid learning is here to stay. Especially thanks to the perfect match made by Acer Chromebook and Google Workspace for Education.\n\nStar International is a family-run community-based school with a British curriculum located in Dubai, in the residential area of Mirdif, which is opening its first Year Ten Cohort next year. ??I think our teachers are amazing and they have adapted amazingly well during Covid.?? says Oates ??What Google Workspace for Education enabled us to do, is to sort of offer a hybrid model of education. So we have got online lessons going on at the same time as face to face lessons and it??s meant that the learning has never stopped.??\n\n\nMaking Hybrid Learning more effective with Acer Chromebook & Google Workspace for Education\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 512 became the new favourite companion for the students at Star International. What teachers love the most about it is that it was built specifically for education. It features a ruggedized design and water-resistant keyboard that makes it resistant to daily wear and tear and its performance matches the needs of both teachers and students. Plus, the stylus pen offers an even more immersive experience, as pointed out by Anya from year 7, who particularly enjoyed drawing and sketching with it.\n\nThe 12?? inch display of the students?? Chromebooks is a perfect fit for co-working. Collaboration is also made possible between students learning from home and the ones attending classes in person thanks to Google Workspace for Education. Apps like Google Slides and Google Docs allow students to team up and work simultaneously side by side on projects, making collaboration happen anywhere effortlessly.\n\n\nEdTech and its role in Education\n\nTeachers from Star International also enjoyed the benefits of integrating Acer Chromebook and Google Workspace for Education in their everyday school life, growing more and more tech-savvy as weeks go by. According to Mr Oates, EdTech resources like these did not actually change the way teachers operate, but, more importantly, they enhanced it.\n\nThey made education happen in times when the traditional in-person approach was not possible. They elevate productivity, collaboration and classroom management for both students and teachers.\n\nWatch the video above to get inspired by the story of Star International School.\n\nAnd if you are looking for an effective and powerful combination of devices and resources for education to elevate hybrid learning in your school, don??t hesitate to contact us to find the solution that fits your needs: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com\n\n\nSuccess Story Key Info\nSchool name: Star International School, Dubai ?V UAE\nAcer devices: Acer Chromebooks Spin 512\nReseller contact: LearnIT ?V info@learnitacademy.com'),

This is why we engage them in projects revolving around our solutions. Because we consider them the present and the future of innovation.\n\nFor that reason, we asked students from the three-year IED courses of the School of Visual Arts, Design, and Alumni of the Master course in Design Innovation, Strategy and Product to propose new design scenarios and possible innovation trends for our brand new ConceptD portfolio.\n\n\nThe project: scope, research and development\n\nFifteen selected IED students and alumni formed three competing interdisciplinary teams; each one had to design a product concept involving different disciplines and creativities using an innovative high-quality design approach.\n\nThe teams got to work developing their final product concepts to be presented in the form of a digital project presentation to a committee made up of Acer representatives and IED Milan professionals.\n\nThe Innovation Design Lab was a doubly beneficial experience: on one side, students had the opportunity to see first-hand how a professional creative process looks like. On the other hand, company representatives witnessed an inspiring display of talent and new ideas.\n\n\nMeet the teams and their concepts\n\nSelecting the most deserving project was no easy task thanks to the high level of ideas developed by the young creative teams.\n\nTeam White presented a project centred on a new relationship between devices and creators. Boasting on advanced ways to control software and tools through gestures, the team??s Vision Dual and Vision MR were introduced as innovative creative companions designed with particular attention to posture and healthy viewing distance. The two devices were conceived to offer a large screen experience ?V typical of studios ?V on the go, with no compromises in terms of workflow.\n\nThe keyword of Team Raven??s proposal was ??seamless??. Their D FLOW combined all the functionalities of a device with positive daily sensations, to elevate the level of empathy around the product. Their workstation was highlighted by different components that come into play only when needed. From power-sharing among the parts to streamlined data access, the D FLOW broke away from the idea of laptop as a single device. They focused instead on a system of devices that ??help each other?? in completing single tasks, replicating human cooperation.\n\nFinally, Team DEM developed a way to fill the gap between digital and physical communication. Litterae and Litterae II were designed to bring a laptop and controller together in a convenient two-piece toolset, ideal for creators who seek inspiration anytime and anywhere. In their vision, creators wouldn??t need any additional device or tool. Thanks to Litterae they would be able to automatically collect and organise information in clusters, managed by the users through filters and keywords.\n\nAll teams worked hard and put all their passion into their work, but ultimately Team DEM??s concept stood out, impressing the jury with their ??phygital?? laptop and becoming the winning project.\n\n\nUnleashing pure creativity with ConceptD\n\nStudents and alumni from IED had the chance to rely on a great creative companion throughout the duration of the Innovation Design Lab: ConceptD.\n\nThe colour accuracy and high visual fidelity provided by the devices?? display played a major role in the realisation of the projects. The latest Intel Core processors enabled all participants to manage complex visual effects and heavy 3-D renderings with ease, while the simple and pure design of ConceptD ?V in complete harmony with the project scope ?V allowed both students and alumni to express their creativity in total freedom.\n\nLearn more about the Acer Innovation Design Lab through the voice of the people who participated in the video above. \n\n\nWould you like to learn more about our ConceptD portfolio for creative students and schools?

Their focus is offering to schools the IT support and hardware they need to deliver a personalised learning experience to their students. \n\nIn 2018 the Dutch schools of SOBZ and Spil merged to become Ante. Soon all the schools of the group aligned themselves in the use of Google Classroom and the online COOL Platform to make the best out of online learning and easily share information, collaborate on documents and access their files from anywhere. By doing so, they all enhanced their collaboration through one single online portal and environment. Today, Ante consists of 12 schools with 250 employees and 2000 students. Their learning experience has already been enhanced by Acer Chromebook 311, a trustworthy device that is helping foster their skills and prepare them for their future. \n\n\nAcer Chromebook at Ante: the best companion to teach remotely \n\nAs the importance of distance learning and remote meetings grew exponentially over the past year, Ante has decided to provide their teachers with their own device: the Acer Chromebook 314 (C933T). In the words of Peter Hulstein, School Director of the OBS de Wetering Primary School: \n\n??Teachers were using small student devices with low-quality cameras or their personal computers. Acer Chromebooks give them a smooth working experience thanks to the 14?? touch screen, powerful WiFi 5 connection and a battery that works for two school days before it needs to be charged. This is also a big step forward in our commitment to working GDPR-compliant.??\n\nHulstein continues by explaining how this implementation helped keep school data on safe servers and devices. In fact, now teachers can easily log in with their school accounts and work on the cloud safely. When their work is done, they simply log out from their Chromebooks. In a nutshell, teachers can access useful data without any concern.\n\nIn addition to security, the upgrade to Acer Chromebook provided great flexibility for schools?? employees. With the lightweight design of the device and the padded case provided by Ante, the home-school route is now a comfortable experience. Plus, their part-time teachers can easily join meetings from home, making it easier for everyone to stay connected.\n\n\nAcer for Education, Cloudwise and COOL come together \n\nThanks to the cloud management offered by Cloudwise, teachers can work smoothly on their Chromebooks. They can now focus on elevating their skills in the use of the COOL and Google functionalities for education with no burden. \n\nAs a matter of fact, Ante??s Chairman of the board Geurt Morren, and Peter Hulstein confirm that teachers and students are happy with the COOL Platform. ??They can find and use everything easily at school, but also from home. They just have to log in once into COOL and then have access to all their educational apps through the tiles in the dashboard. Teachers are very happy with the Monitoring module [?K] Also, the easy reset of student passwords by the teachers themselves is a popular feature.??\n\n??Cloudwise provides us with hardware, like the Acer Chromebooks, manages our school network and we??re using their COOL Platform.??

So why aren??t we providing our students with the right tools?\n\nIt shouldn??t be a surprise to anyone that the youth of today outshine most adults when it comes to sheer technology knowledge. You know that super hip messaging app your friend told you about? Your neighbor who just turned eleven used it a year ago, got bored and now uses the successor (of the successor) to that very app. \n\nWith this in mind, it is important for educational institutions to have the right tools to develop students?? abilities and safely guide their movements in the digital universe.\n\nBy offering students able devices (such as Acer??s ConceptD line of computers), digital tools and programs or apps that are intuitive, fun and easy to use, students can not only acquire new knowledge but at the same time make their classroom experience much more interactive and creative.\n\nWe believe that the proper use of technology nurtures a positive behavior in students, who then feel more engaged with their classmates, teachers and also the subjects they are taught. In the long run this will result in a more effective learning experience and to gain the best results both teachers and students must be able to speak the same ??language??.\n\n\nDigital creativity is crucial\n\nAcer is a technology partner at the Future Classroom Lab (FCL), which is part of the EU collaboration European Schoolnet. Denmark is represented in the project in the form of the Center for Teaching Aids (CFU). For the past two years, we have followed the Future Classroom Lab closely and witnessed their experiments with the development of an entirely new school subject ?V technology understanding. A full report with results is expected to be published when the project is completed, but one thing is already certain ?V a large part of the topic should and will be built on the concept of digital creativity.\n\nAlthough the subject itself naturally will cover topics such as how to safely navigate the often complex high seas of our ever expanding virtual world, it is even more important to expand on the opportunities that exist.\n\nOr to put it simple ?V we need to help young people take the crucial step from being just plain digital consumers to becoming virtual creators. \n\n??Great, so we??ll teach them how to code. Simple, eh???\n\nWell, mastering some or maybe even a few of these new languages surely is one part of the solution. But so is showing kids how an app is built, what a computer looks like on the inside and how a robot works. Only with this insight can children and young people also understand the possibilities and limitations that these amazing technical tools bring. \n\n\nConceptD assists both teacher and student\n\nSo, where to start? We suggest by investing in good, purpose built hardware. Acer??s ConceptD series of computers has been specifically designed for creative work in the digital sphere and thus is the perfect tool for creatives. ConceptD Windows 10 Pro devices can help schools to prepare students for the future by providing a platform for collaborating, exploring, personalized learning and productivity.\n\nFor example, all Acer ConceptD computers have monitors that are PANTONE? validated and achieve 100 percent of Adobe??s RGB? color spectrum and Delta E <2 color accuracy. This means that the colors displayed on the screen are 100 percent true to life, a necessity for those who work with visual elements. This applies, for example, to the popular ConceptD 3 Ezel.\n\nDigital creativity also requires a lot of muscle. Aand we?re not talking about going to the gym, even though this has its own benefits to creativity according to research. Weak processors and aged graphics cards may put a wet, soggy blanket on just about any vivid vision. Fortunately, Acer??s ConceptD products live up to the strictest of requirements, with hardware ready to unleash and power any creative mind ?V without hiccups. This includes not running out of steam, which is why the aforementioned ConceptD 3 offers battery life of up to 30 hours.\n\nTake your creativity to the next level ?V contact us to discover more about ConcepD: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com  '),

An important contributor to the positive change is Second English Language High School ??Thomas Jefferson?? ?V a leading by example school, based in Sofia, Bulgaria. The exceptional achievements of our school triggered a large-scale digitization project for Sofia schools. Second English Language High School ??Thomas Jefferson?? is already an Acer Innovative School and a Google reference school. Looking ahead into the near future, the school is motivated to establish more 1:1 classes with personal devices for every student and every teacher by the end of the year. However, let us ask ?V how did their digital transformation start?\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks and G Suite for Education for a project-based learning \n\n1:1 on Chromebooks did not just change the media by replacing textbooks with the latest generation of Chromebooks. Second English Language High School ??Thomas Jefferson?? in Sofia is transforming the learning process with a student-centered approach and deep understanding of project-based learning, supported by strong learning activity designed by its teachers. The school environment had to change as well. Students are free to team up and cooperate through their own learning. Technology, free communication and respect of individuality are the norm for both students and teachers.\nThe change began with one class in 8th grade (age 14) in which each student and each teacher received training with their personal Chromebooks. In most subjects, students do not use textbooks, but learn through group projects guided by their teachers. The goal is that by 2021 all students from 8th to 10th grade (400 students) have their own Chromebook, and all teachers are Google Certified Educators with deep understanding in project-based learning. The first classes on 1:1 kicked off using the affordable Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (R721T). Later, teachers were equipped with the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 (R852TN) with a WACOM stylus and Acer Chromebook 13 (CB713-1WN), featuring powerful Intel Core i3 processors.\nThe high school has already implemented a cloud platform Google G Suite for Education, in which every student and teacher has an electronic profile in the domain of the organization. The implementation of a cloud platform is supported by Center for Creative Training, the School Board and the parents of 8th grade students.\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks and G Suite for Education for a project-based learning\n\n1:1 on Chromebooks did not just change the media by replacing textbooks with the latest generation of Chromebooks.

The implementation of a cloud platform is supported by Center for Creative Training, the School Board and the parents of 8th grade students.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Acer Chromebooks the perfect companion for the new 1:1 project\n\nSchool life can be tough: when choosing what device to use for such a large-scale\nproject, not just any computer will do. Here is what makes Acer Chromebooks the ideal\noption:\n?? A battery that lasts throughout the school day\nDepending on how long your local school day is, a device meant to be used as a learning support needs to have a sufficient battery life to last several hours at varying levels of almost non-stop activity, and Acer Chromebooks have been proven to meet this requirement.\n?? A durable device for even the toughest day\nThe military grade durability and impact-resistant body of Acer Chromebooks are designed to survive being shoved in and out of schoolbags by even the clumsiest user.\n?? One device, infinite activities\nNot all subjects involve the same kind of activity, so a school device needs a degree of flexibility. With several modes to choose from, Acer Chromebooks can adapt to any activity in seconds.\n?? Make your learning more efficient\nWith shared calendars, sharing files and opening a constant three-way channel of communication that involves teachers, students and families, learning is smoother than ever.\n\n\nHow can schools trigger regional transformation and investments in education?\n\nThe foundations were laid in 2019. Firstly, all teachers and students got their personal G Suite accounts. Furthermore, all of the learning resources and documentation were transferred to the cloud, so that teachers and administration have centralized access to them and save up time. Secondly, the 1:1 (one-to-one) model was established. All teachers and students have access to learning resources everywhere and anytime.\nIn 2 ELS there are 1138 personal Google G Suite accounts; over 180 Acer Chromebooks for a total of 5 classes of 8th and 9th grade students; a personal Acer Chromebook for each teacher in the One-to-One (1:1) classes; and 21 certified teachers in the Google Certified Educator programs.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Education requested a special case study on the 1:1 model in Bulgaria\n\n\nOne year of educational transformation focused on the 1:1 model was a research object, when the Ministry of Education and Science commissioned a case study on the model.\nThe case study scope:\n\n??7 schools\n??Over 800 students, teachers and parents in 1:1 and traditional class setup\n??6000+ personal G Suite accounts.\n\nKey findings:\n\n??Parents began to support the 1:1 model just three months after the start.\n??Project based learning is the new norm for 1:1 classes\n??Teachers become designers of the educational process and use digital technology\n??Students and teachers have greater respect for each other and are more confident to find, process and express information from various sources.\n\n\nSofia City started an ambitious program to support 1:1 and educational transformation\n\nFollowing the deployment of G Suite for Education and the training of teachers, the 1:1 model was established. Thanks to the support and financing of Sofia municipality, teachers from 16 schools are preparing for the launch of 1:1 model in their schools. The change began with a class in which each student and each teacher works with their personal Acer Chromebook, a laptop designed specifically for cloud schools. In most subjects, students do not use textbooks, but learn through group projects guided by their teachers.\n\n\nTeachers as drivers of innovation in 2 ELS \n\nIn order for digital transformation to happen, a crucial step is to have qualified teachers on board. It all started with 8 teachers being intensively trained for Google Certified Educator level 1 and level 2. Just a year later the school has its first Google Certified Trainer ?V Ms. Adi Konedareva. She is determined to help fellow teachers and the Google Trainers community work more efficiently with cloud-based tools, create engaging content and develop their leadership skills by conducting at least 12 training sessions per year.\n\n\nCovid situation\n\nThe global coronavirus outbreak influenced Bulgarian learning environment as well. All of the educational institutes were closed for three months in 2020. Since last week, schools are locked once again until further notice.\nThe early on implementation of the cloud platform G Suite for Education and the introduction of the 1:1 model resulted in a smooth distance learning transition. Luckily, the teachers, students and administration of 2 ELS ??Thomas Jefferson?? are already prepared to work in a cloud-based environment. Cloud, learning environment, WiFi, Chromebook devices and regulations are the tools that ensure the success of distance learning in 2 ELS ??Thomas Jefferson??.\n\n\n2 ELS is announced as a Google reference school\n\n2 ELS ??Thomas Jefferson?? is the first Google reference school in Sofia and only the second Google reference school in Central and Eastern Europe. The other one is also in Bulgaria ?V Ivan Vazov Language High School in Plovdiv.\nSucceeding the focused and motivated efforts, an online event took place to announce the big news on the 29.10.2020. The important event was featuring Yordanka Fandakova, Mayor of Sofia, Gencho Kerezov, Deputy Mayor for Digitalization, Innovation and Economic Development of Sofia Municipality, Mark Sans Lopez, Director of Education at Google for Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Stefan Stoyanov, Deputy Mayor for Education and Business Development in the Municipality of Plovdiv, Dr. Vanya Kastreva, Head of the Regional management of Education Sofia, Karina Angelieva, Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Prof. Dr. Galin Tsokov from Plovdiv University Paisii Hilendarski and a team of Center for Creative Training.\nThe accomplishments of 2 ELS ??Thomas Jefferson?? would not have been possible without the support of Sofia Municipality and the Regional management of education ?V Sofia, which facilitated the digital transformation of the educational environment in the capital. Currently, 40 schools are already doing the 1:1 model or are in preparation to begin doing so, starting from the second term of the school year.'),

At the same time one of the key exercise is the digital expertise, which needs to be learned and experienced by students and teachers in the daily operations.\nThe K?the-Kollwitz- School Recklinghausen has purchased 100 Acer Chromebook Tab 10 to accelerate the technical development and to accomplish a higher acceptance of learning. The Acer Chomebook Tab 10 is a capable Education-Tablet, which is based on a secure and intuitive Chrome-OS-operation system.\n\n\nEffective education with modern technology\n\nIn this project a technically high-quality and well integrable solution is used at the same time. At the K?the Kollwitz School Recklinghausen the use of the devices is currently being tested intensively. ??Currently we are having a longer test stage and searching for the ideal possible application for the modern devices,?? said teacher Holger Meyring. So far only teachers have been provided with Chrometabs, in order to set a good example and to create lessons as digital and innovative as possible.\n\n\nMore technology in all school areas\n\nTeachers are already using the devices in all their subjects to transmit digital content to the larger screens of smart TVs. Even students in grade 5 are already able to make their first experience with the latest technology. Since February 2020, all teachers in grades 5 to 13 have been introduced to the hardware and software step by step. By using additional aids like the integrated pen which makes the transition from classical to digital learning noticeably easier, it is possible to make important entries directly on the Chrometab.\nIn all classrooms, the devices are linked with the network via Wi-Fi to distribute research tasks and to connect the systems to the Internet. The simple use of Chromebook Tabs makes communication between teachers and other colleagues easier. This can take place, via digital class registers that can be accessed from any device.\n\n\nSignificant less time and planning effort\n\nAs many teachers already have sufficient IT-skills, the first steps of linkage were easy to manage. Improved comfort and the simple access help the teachers to transfer this added value to the students and increase their satisfaction. This is also shown by positive resonance from teachers.\nThe first interim conclusion: using Chromebook Tab 10 provides a more creative and diversify arrangement of lessons, and a higher willingness to learn by students. For example, this makes it possible to screen images and videos, to use teaching and learning apps and visualize existing lesson results. Acer Chromebook Tab10 with the Google Classroom can be used without much organizational effort. The Chromebook Tabs 10 are extremely robust, are characterized by a high-resolution QXGA display and feature about the full integration of Google Expeditions. In this way, digitisation becomes a successful process and previous barriers will be removed.\n\n\n\n\nDiverse ideas for modern Learning\n\nThe positive experiences with the Chromebook Tabs 10 also make ??desire for more?? at the K?the-Kollwitz-School Recklinghausen. According to the responsible teacher Holger Meyring: ??The first step is to enable the implementation of Chromebook Tabs for all teachers. Afterwards, we also involve the students in the technical use and develop new systems for the digital extension of our learning offers.??\n\n\nWith each other ?V For each other ?V Development at the K?the Kollwitz School\n\nThe Philosophy of the school ??With each other ?V For each other?? and the digital eduactional concepts will therefore be even better complementary in the future. Acer Chromebook Tabs 10 create a successful working environment and support a corporate feeling by providing uniformity for daily school life. In combination with modern Wi-Fi and the implementation of other digital projects, all students will be involved in digital learning prospectively. Thanks to Acer for education, a positive contribution is already being made today to the technically secure development in schools helping to integrate the modern Acer Chromebook Tab 10 functionally into daily school routine.\nThe Acer Chromebook Tab 10 is the only tablet with Chrome OS that provides excellent image quality with its 2,048??1,536 QXGA resolution. The stylus with Wacom ? technology, offers a natural writing experience for all kind of notes. The Acer Chromebook Tab 10 becomes a digital classroom for teachers and students with a high level of usability.'),

Currently, it has more than 1,760 students distributed from Pre-School Education to High School. Its aim is to train the students so that they can better respond to the new demands of society.\nIt is a multilingual school, with international projection and committed to the ethical development of their students. They are firmly committed to the innovation, guaranteeing the intellectual and professional training of their students, and attending in a special way to the new social requirements in the field of new technologies, learning and knowledge. Therefore, they were looking for a technological transformation that would improve their management and communication, at the service of the new educational methodologies implemented in recent years.\n\nGoing One-to-One with Acer Chromebook Spin 511\n\nSince the beginning of this year, 2019-20, San Cayetano School has lauched the ??One to One?? Project (one student, one computer): students from 5th grade of Primary to 4th grade of ESO have started using their own Acer Chromebook as a learning tool both at school and at home.\nWhen they started with the preparation and design of the One to One Project, they considered the present and future needs, coming to the conclusion that the equipments to be implemented in the school should meet these four requirements:\n1. Battery life: their students will spend between 7 and 8 hours per day using the devices in class. They need enough autonomy to cover that need. Acer Chromebook Spin 511 devices provide up to 10 hours of battery life, meeting their needs for a long school day.\n2. Device durability: The computers will be used by students from different years and ages. They needed devices that could take the daily knocks of students. The Acer Chromebook Spin 511 devices, designed with military grade durability and impact resistant body, fulfills this necessity.\n3. Multi-function: Depending on the dynamism of the classes, they were looking for a device that could be adapted to every need. Acer Chromebook Spin 511 with its 360 articulated touch screen and integrated stylus offers this adaptability.\n4. Reliability and solvency: Appealing to the duration and extension of the project, they required a leading, reliable and cutting-edge brand. During the previous years, the school introduced a project with the 340 Acer R3-131T that was shared by students according to the needs of each moment. This gave them the chance to meet Acer, their performance and the relationship with their customers.\n\n\nThe experience of San Cayetano School with Acer Chromebook Spin 511\n\nSince the One to One project has been implemented, every student from 5th grade of primary school to 4th grade of secondary school uses an Acer Chromebook. The following two years this project will also be extended to the 1st and 2nd year of High School, respectively. Teachers from San Cayetano School suddenly highlight the ease and fast adaptation of all the students to these devices, and the support and total acceptance by all families.\nDue to the arrival of these Chromebook devices, designed for their educational environment, the learning possibilities inside the classroom are almost infinite. For example, teachers can provide to their students videos or podcast tutorials about the different subjects.\nOne of the advantages of replacing textbooks with these personal computers and digital editions, is allowing teachers and students to save paper and take care of the environment and facilitates transportation, since all content is always available on the device.\nCommunication between students and teachers is particularly easy. Students can access to the virtual classrooms of each subject, send emails to the teacher, ask questions in the class group or even specify personalized tutoring hours through the calendar, just using the Chromebook.\nOverall, three different Chromebook models were used: Acer Chromebook Spin 13, for the management team and those responsible of implementing ICT at the school; Acer Chromebook Spin 512, for the teaching staff and Acer Chromebook Spin 511, for the exclusive use of students.\n\nVoice to the classrooms\nAfter a progressive approach, the improvement of the Internet connection and the use of these very reliable devices, San Cayetano School staff can conclude that the result of the One to One project has been positive when observing the day to day of the students, their opinions and experiences.\nThese are some of the great changes that they have been able to experience:\n\n??Improvement in the management and organization of the center through shared calendars and One Drive.\n??Faster and more fluid communication at all levels (between teachers and areas, from teachers to students, between teachers and families?K).\n??Gamification is applied in all subjects and years.\nThe students are highly motivated by the development of their tasks on the Chromebook so they can focus better in the execution of their tasks.\n??It allows students to cooperate in the virtual environment, which is also highly valued by the school??s families ?Xit avoids the need for students to meet in person during weekends.\n??The Chromebook makes it easy to transport the books, because they are all accessible from the device.\n??It promotes children??s creativity through very useful, simple and dynamic tools.\n\n??We have the chance to create interesting contents available to the students. Acer devices are durable, easy to use, with unlimited storage and quick start, with extended battery life, that improves the cooperative work between students and teachers and allows a very secure manage over the Chromebook??.\nDefinitely, ??Acer??s solutions for education have been a success and allowed us to carry out the digital transformation necessary to complete our educational project??.

The State School of Arnstorf, in Germany, thus provides the best conditions for pupils to prepare for the digital working environment.\n\n\nSouthern Germany schools as pioneers of innovation\n\nMany schools in the southern part of Germany already have modern learning systems and technical equipment to prepare pupils for the education of the future. This trend is also going in the right direction at the Realschule Arnstorf (RSA). The coordinating teacher Michael P?ppl stresses the fact that the school is already well equipped with laptops, WLAN and even its own robotics room.\nFor eight years now, the Google G Suite has been the foundation of digital learning at school, which can now be combined with 30 new Acer Chromebooks Spin 11. They are exactly the right learning platform for working modern and effective at the same time. What do the students love most about this? The Acer Spin 11 can be used in both notebook and tablet mode.\n\n\nState-of-the-art technology in digital school life\n\n\nBehind this success story is the new Chrome operating system which makes the intuitive Acer Chromebooks the optimal educational laptop. The devices start up very quickly and are ready for use in just a few seconds. With the help of a cloud, efficient and modern storage is possible without any problems so that the processed files can be accessed flexibly at any time and anywhere.\nWith integrated virus protection and additional data encryption in the cloud, Chromebooks are best protected for every application. The battery life is also lasts for the entire school day, even when actively used, so that the devices can be ideally integrated into the lessons and become a functional part of the digital classroom.\n\n\nIntuitive and progressive ?V a true enrichment for the classroom\n\nAt Arnstorf school all pupils and teachers are involved in the use of the equipment. ??All of the approximately 700 students and 60 teachers have their own Google Classroom access,?? Mr. P?ppl points out. Seamless integration into existing school operations makes the devices a universal companion that will soon be available in all class levels. During the test phase, however, the new Chromebooks have so far only been used in the 5th, 8th and 9th grade to test the possibilities and application areas.\nBy using the Chromebooks, applications such as Google Classroom, Google Docs and Google Drive are now also included in the lessons. During the current pilot phase, the devices and their applications will be used for productive and modern work in the subjects of German, biology, art, computer sciences and geography. This allows students to create presentations, work together on documents and search for key information during digital project work.\n\n\nIncreasingly more digital presence at school\n\nTo answer the question of whether or not the devices save time, the answer is definetely yes: ??After a brief familiarisation phase of pupils and colleagues, the lessons can be designed faster and more modern,?? says teacher P?ppl. Not only will more content and structure become part of the digital classroom, but the students will also have a lot more fun learning thanks to help of the technology.\nBy connecting to existing laptops, more and more students can work on the devices at the same time, making communication easier. However, not only the laptops interact perfectly with each other, but also the other equipment purchased by the ??Digital Pact for School?? can easily be connected to the Chromebooks. The contents of the laptops can be easily transferred to the existing 75-inch displays via Google Chromecast and edited with WLAN in front of the whole class.\n\n\n\nSustainable concepts for effective learning\n\nAt the State School in Arnstorf the digital classroom is no longer a dream of the future. Through the comprehensive integration of Chromebooks in schools, existing processes are to be geared even more specifically to digital learning in the future in order to introduce pupils and teachers to the use of the devices.\nTeacher P?ppl is still reserved on the subject of whether the digital components will be a worthy successor to pen and paper. ??A combination of digital and analogue solutions will continue to be essential in the future. The great task for all schools will be to find a reasonable and purposeful combination.?? With the Chromebooks the right approach for this development is already being created today. Thanks to the Wacom pen integrated in the case, you can also work with the Acer Chromebooks Spin 11 in a classic digital handwriting style at any time.\nUntil the completed integration, teachers have the opportunity to train themselves further through internal school training and to also understand all the basics of the equipment. A new digital age is dawning for pupils and teachers at the State School of Arnstorf with modern equipment. New meets old, motivation meets rejection and digital strategies meet proven teaching strategies. Does this step work? ??We personally look to the future with confidence and are looking forward to becoming part of this development ourselves with Acer Chromebooks and Google Classroom,?? says P?ppl.'),

Bon Soleil experience with Acer Chromebooks\n\nThe Lyc?e Fran?ais de Gav? Bon Soleil is an international school founded in 1969 in Gav?, a town near Barcelona. This multilingal school already started a digital transformation process in the recent years, but the Covid-10 outbreak in the latest months has compelled the Bon Soleil Centre to definitely accelerate it. Here??s how Acer ?V along with FDOS Software, supplier of equipment and computer solutions ?V has equipped 200 devices to students and teachers to teach, learn and collaborate within a new educational frame. The use of these resources provided by Acer has been absolutely crucial for the proper performance of work dynamics between teachers and students during the quarantine.\n\n\nFitting classroom and remote learning needs\n\nLocated in the Province of Barcelona in Spain, Lyc?e Fran?ais de Gav? Bon Soleil is an educational centre with more than 1,300 pupils, ranging from pre-school education to Baccalaureate. Their pedagogical aim is to train educated people and citizens, endowed with critical sense and moral qualities, who are especially capable of contributing to the material and moral improvement of humanity.\nIt??s a multilingual school, with international projection, with students from 17 different nationalities living together in their classrooms. Strongly committed to the ethical and moral development of its students, the centre is also firmly committed to classroom innovations. On this matter, they are in the process of digitizing their classrooms with the gradual acquisition of computer products and services, as well as the adoption of new educational methodologies that have already been implemented in recent years.\nBut the ongoing pandemic changed the situation, bringing out more needs. The devices for students and teachers had to fit not only with all-day school needs, but also with remote learning from home. The Bon Soleil centre was looking for robust and easy to use (and to manage from IT departmend) devices, facilitating cooperation and collaboration. For these reasons, they chose Acer Chromebook C730, C731, C732 and C733 models for students. These equipments fully meet their needs:\n\n??Battery life: Acer Chromebook devices provide up to 12 hours of use, fully covering the need for battery life throughout school hours.\n??Resistance: Students of different stages and ages will use the equipment. They need devices supporting the daily treatment of the students. Acer Chromebook devices exceed their expectations thanks to their military grade and impact resistance.\n??Integration with the G-Suite platform: They needed devices adaptable to a wide range of tasks. This adaptability is offered by Acer Chromebook devices by including all the functions of G Suite for Education, to stay connected (Gmail, Meets), create (Docs) and store (Drive) working papers, among many other needs.\n??Simplified Management: Due to the duration and extent of the state of alarm, the security checkups and students?? devices administration by IT department, as well as the monitoring of their activity by the teachers is another really important point. Therefore, Acer Chromebook devices provide flexible access to manage device settings and monitor them, through the Google management console.\n\n\n\nRemote learning with Acer Chromebooks: the experience of Bon Soleil students and teachers\n\nThe institution itself says that they are very happy with Acer, both for the quality of the products offered and the after-sales service. In total, 4 different Chromebook models were used: Acer Chromebook C730, C731, C732 and C733, for the exclusive use of students; and higher performance devices for the management team and those responsible for implementing ICT in the school.\nCommunication between students and teachers during the quarantine was especially simple. Students could access the virtual classrooms of each subject and check the syllabus with Classroom, send emails to the teachers, ask questions in the class group through Meets or even specify hours of personalized tutoring through Calendar, with their own Chromebook devices.\nAfter a gradual start over several years, and after attending a pandemic context with teachers and students locked in their homes, the final result of the project to integrate digital resources in the classrooms of Gav? Bon Soleil could not be more positive.\nSome of the great discoveries they have been able to experience during the quarantine have been the following ones:\n\n??Access to information: The students have more independence in the learning process, and they can access the working tools in Google Classroom on their own. This section also allows students at the Baccalaureate level to have more autonomy that will bring them closer to the dynamics of university education.\n??Improvement in communication: Tools like Classroom or Meets allow real-time contact between classmates and teachers when it comes to working and sharing documents and information which, in turn, stimulates teamwork.\n??Digital evaluation: Students have access to much more dynamic and immediate evaluations, while the teacher receives much more information from the tests.'),

From drawing with Google Canvas, to charting and graphing experiment results in science, to improving language and digital literacy skills in one fell swoop by editing their own videos in language classes, students at Al Khubairat are learning the most important lesson of all: no part of life can do without technology in this day and age and school is no exception.\nBy applying technology equally to all lessons and using G-Suite as a great, unified hub for all their learning, students are also given the chance to see with their own eyes that all human knowledge is interconnected and that even in today??s highly specialised world, there is value in knowing a little bit of everything and in staying curious.\nIt is plain to see that Acer Chromebooks and G-Suite have made a positive difference in these young people??s lives and we would like to take the time to express our wish that such a difference may carry over into their adult years and shape them into men and women who can build a better future for all of us.'),

These difficulties can be divided into four categories:\n\n??Internet connectivity: many students had problems to connect their own devices to the school Wi-Fi;\n??Compatibility: different devices mean different software, and this led to complexity in terms of files and tools compatibility;\n??Duration: the devices battery didn??t last the full school day;\n??Security: students could access inappropriate material on the Internet, endangering the security of the school network.\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks and G-Suite for Education for a 1:1 deployment\n\nTo solve this situation, the Naseem International School IT worked to improve the Wi-Fi infrastructure at first. Then, the school board approved to deploy G-Suite for Education and all teachers had been trained to Google certified Level 1.\nNaseem International School then chose Acer Chromebook R11 and Acer Chromebook Spin 11 as ideal laptops for its students. Along with Acer, the school piloted 300 Acer Chromebooks across 2-year groups. Both teachers and students were immediately so satisfied with these devices that the project has been now expanded to Grade 3-12 with Chromebooks work stations for Grade 1 and Grade 2.\nThe benefits of Acer Chromebooks and G-Suite for Education on teaching and learning were tangible right from the start, not only for technical upgrades (i.e.: battery with an all-day lasting). The most appreciated improvement concerns security: students of Naseem International School can now browse the Internet in a safe and secure environment, with dedicated apps and extensions for purposeful educational value.\nFor all these reasons, Naseem International School has estimated that all its students (1:1) will have an Acer Chromebook and G-Suite for Education within 2021.\n\nWhat do you think about it?

The school??s intention to assign devices to students and rely on technology in class was initially met with diffidence on the parents?? part, but a gradual introduction of personal devices and wi-fi coverage on the school premises combined with the use of an age-appropriate parental program ultimately led to an engaging classroom environment where learning STEAM subjects is a fun game and technology acts as a connecting bridge between all areas of knowledge.\n\n\nAbu Dhabi Grammar School, Dubai\n\nGoverned by both Canada and the United Arab Emirates, this school is a slice of Canada in downtown Abu Dhabi, providing dual diplomas at the end of the students?? school career and ensuring they are ready to take on the world?Xwith their trusty Acer devices to help them. With the introduction of coding lessons, G Suite apps for managing schoolwork, and hundreds of devices for a gradual elimination of the need for students to bring their own, Abu Dhabi Grammar School is a shining example of the true impact of technology on educational philosophy: using technology in class is not just about replacing pen and paper with screens, it is about learning to do things the previous generation would have thought impossible.\n\n\nLiceo Melchiorre Gioia, Italy\n\nIn this Italian high school, the road to a better education for students starts from educating teachers. Training more and more teachers to use technology to make lessons more engaging and manage the administrative aspects of the job ensures that the school is up to date with the exacting requirements of the current job market, where soft and digital skills are a precious commodity. That is why students and teachers took part in the two-day workshop Scuola e Virtuale on the potentially endless applications of virtual reality to education: many teachers may still be unfamiliar with the latest cutting-edge technology, but it is never too late to learn. After all, the best teachers are those who learn alongside their students.\n\n\nSelborne Primary School, South Africa\n\nStart them young. This South African school has partnered with Acer in order to train both teachers and students in a responsible use of technology not just for technology??s sake, but to help young boys grow into the men of tomorrow: good digital citizens who will have a healthy relationship with their devices and the Internet and will be able to use technology to express their ideas and passions to the fullest. From equipping them with basic ICT skills to honing their coding, design and research abilities, Selborne Primary School, with a little help from Acer, is helping raise a generation of innovators.'),

In 2019 Berkeley Green UTC was also included in the Microsoft Showcase Schools list, after being recognized by the company.\nFor starting the project, Gaia Technology had a main role: the company provided support for new technologies, ICT infrastructure and end-user devices to Berkeley Green UTC, and then introduced the school to Microsoft Office 365 and the Acer TravelMate Spin B1.\n\n\nAcer TravelMate Spin B1: powerful, easy to use and lightweight\n\nThe school chose the Acer TravelMate Spin B1 for their students and teachers. All notebooks feature low-power-consuming Intel? Celeron? processors with improved graphics and fast SSD and HDD storage drives. Moreover, the TravelMate Spin B1 works on the Windows 10 Pro operating system with special S mode, which stands for Simplicity, Security and Speed. But that??s not all.\nThe TravelMate Spin B1 has a convertible design with sleek 11.6?? FHD and HD displays ensuring comfortable use when collaborating on group projects, doing homework or preparing for tests. Students can learn anywhere and anytime thanks to 360?X hinges and four different modes: laptop, stand, tent and tablet. The durability is another important feature: Acer TravelMate Spin B1 are provided with screens made of protective Corning Gorilla Glass featuring Native Damage Resistance. In this way, the notebook resists to scratches, pressure and damage. Moreover, the keyboards are spill-resistant and all the devices are provided with shock-absorbent rubberised bumpers and 122cm drop protection.\n\n\nResults and feedback about the partnership with Acer and Microsoft\n\n??The Spin B118s strike a good balance between cost, size and features. The touchscreen means that students are able to quickly interact with their device and get access to resources more quickly. The folding screen allows them to use the device as a tablet, which many do, using the stylus, and they find that the long battery life enables them to learn all day without needing to recharge. The resilience of the device to water spills is impressive, because we know that accidents do happen!??, says Rich Williams, SGS Berkeley Green UTC Assistant Principal. \nWe can say the results are very positive: modern devices in schools allow students to develop their skills every day in the fields of Engineering, Digital Technologies and Cyber Security, but also to enhance learning in standard subjects from the school??s curriculum. And what about teachers? Now they have tools to conduct more practical, advanced and engaging classes, thanks to interactive projects and handy devices suitable for students of all ages.'),

Dirk Haijma, the association??s ICT-coordinator, says that a total of 1,200 Acer Chromebooks have been purchased for these seven schools: ??The association has clearly chosen to make a substantial investment in the future. The special thing about De Boustien is that all pupils there have received their own Acer Chromebook.??\n\n\nLooking for laptops ready for today??s students\n\nDirector Ietje de Vries explains that De Boustien was already the only school in the association that worked with Snappet tablets, quickly realising that they were too small and too hard to work with, especially for years four to six: ??So, something better had to take their place.??\nThe process in which it was decided to purchase Acer Chromebooks was in fact quite simple, Haijma adds: ??First, we established what the vision of our association is with respect to digital education. What kind of digital education do we want to provide? Of course, we did this in consultation with the teachers. The results of this discussion were mainly that the computers that we were going to use were to be an integral component of presenting the teaching material. So, it was not just to be a processing unit for the teaching material but a real component of the teaching itself. The computer had to have a keyboard and a very good battery. It also had to be robust and light. And we wanted to provide every pupil here at De Boustien with a laptop. Years one to three ought to have touch because this allows them to work faster and more intuitively and also to use them like a tablet, and the years six to eight shouldn??t have touch. The latter was a financial decision, but children in these groups can work really well with just a keyboard.??\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks are the devices fitting the best with De Boustien school??s needs\n\n??We went to our ICT-service provider VWC with these wishes and a fixed budget??, Haijma continues. ??They came up with these Acer Chromebooks right away. We were immediately impressed by these laptops.??\nThe roll-out began right before summer 2018 and the implementation was completed after summer. Because all 255 pupils have to be able to use the Chromebooks at the same time, the capacity of the WIFI network also had to be expanded.\nAt the end of each teaching day, the Chromebooks are safely stored in locked charging banks. VWC can also provide all necessary updates automatically via the central management environment which means the machines are in top condition every day. In-school management is no longer needed.\n\n\n??The Chromebooks now form an integral component of our instruction??\n \n\nChromebook 11 N7 and Spin 11: the reasons why\n\nThe entire upper school and the teachers at De Boustien got the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 (C731) and the lower school the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 (R751T).\nBoth types are extremely sturdy and shock resistant and therefore especially well-suited for use in classrooms. They are also small (11 inch), thin and light and thus children can handle the Chromebooks easily. The laptops have a unique drainage system which means spilled liquids are drained out through the keyboard without causing any damage. Finally, the touchscreen on the Spin 11 can be completely rotated (360 degrees) and function as a tablet, making it ideal for ??the little ones??.\n\n\nA plus: Acer Chromebooks as means of communication\n\nDirector De Vries has nothing but praise for the Chromebooks: ??The opportunities that these devices offer us are impressive. Not just now, but in the future, too. We just starting out and are still in the phase of familiarising ourselves with them, but I see the interaction between the teachers and pupils increasing.??\nDe Vries ends with a reflection on the decision: ??As said before, we see the Chromebooks not just as a processing unit but mainly as means of communication. Between teacher and pupil, but also pupil to pupil. With an eye on the increasing internationalisation of the world, we intentionally chose to become a school with Early Foreign Language Instruction. Pupils in year six communicate with pupils in other countries in foreign languages. Once they all have their own Chromebooks, this will be better and easier. Thus, with these Chromebooks we have literally put the future into the hands of the pupils.??'),

It started in February 2018, when selected schools were provided with Acer laptops working on the Windows 10 for Education operating system, featuring dedicated software for schools and training for teaching staff.\nThe schools prepared some materials for the Microsoft Educator Community platform,  a free platform for educators from around the world offering on-line courses, educational resources and proposals for projects that can be conducted by schools.\n\n\nA project born from the collaboration among Microsoft and Acer\n\nFour schools participated in the project: Primary School no. 1 in Trzebnica, Primary School no. 2 in Trzebnica, Primary School no. 3 in Trzebnica, and the Primary School in Uje?dziec Wielki. Each school nominated five teachers, who took part in training sessions to apply solutions developed by Microsoft and Acer. What were these solutions about? They were dedicated educational systems implemented with Acer devices running Windows 10 for Education, Intune for Education, Office 365, and Minecraft: Education Edition.\nAt the end of the training sessions, the involved teachers shared their newly-acquired knowledge with other educators in their respective schools.\n\n\nApplications and systems developed for education by Windows\n\nLet??s know more about the applications developed by Windows used during the project.\nWindows for Education is a version of the popular operating system designed specially to meet the needs of schools and education. Thanks to the implementation of additional functions in the OS, all versions of software used within the ??School in the Microsoft and Acer Cloud?? achieve seamless compatibility.\nIntune for Education is a cloud service facilitating mobile device management in schools, as well as management of user access rights to data and applications, delivering robust security in the school ICT ecosystem.\nMinecraft: Education Edition is a version of the popular Minecraft game dedicated to schools. It provides a perfect picture of modern approaches to education facilitating the development of both teamwork skills and creativity in pupils. It represents a powerful combination of fun and learning.\nAll schools participating in the project were able to take advantage of Office 365 for education at no charge, and support was provided by a dedicated Microsoft team. The free-of-charge Office 365 A1 allowed teachers, administrators, and pupils to use functions such as a school e-mail system, a OneDisk virtual drive with 1TB of space for every user, and modern tools for communication and cooperation to enjoy educational anywhere, any time, and on any device. Among these tools were Microsoft Teams, OneNote Class Notebook, and Forms.\n\n\nA daily educational routine overturned from Microsoft and Acer solutions\n\nThe development of School in the Cloud depends to a large extent on the availability of compatible devices with the programme??s requirements. In this year??s edition of the project, these devices were Acer TravelMate B118-RN laptops ?V light and powerful portable computers running on the Windows 10 for Education OS. These machines are equipped with an 11.6?? matte screen, making them convenient, light, and comfortable, both for individual use and during group activities. In addition, each model includes the intuitive Active Stylus, ensuring that the functionality of the touch screen in the TravelMate B118-RN is used to the maximum degree.\nThe project kicked off in February 2018, and the objective was to modernise education by introducing cutting-edge solutions developed by Microsoft and Acer into the daily educational routines of children and youngsters. Dedicated software and comfortable devices in the educational environment are key to growing the potential held by thousands of young people. Enhanced technological resources mean that pupils have far more opportunities to learn in a form that captures their interest and meets their developmental needs. Teachers benefit by receiving a full toolbox they can use to construct engaging lessons, as well as easing the task of handling paperwork and cooperating with other educators and administration. Schools that take advantage of modern technology are more attractive to both pupils and their parents.'),

Furthermore, allowing pupils to use devices to create personalized learning thanks to Intel? processors inside, which includes learning preferences, distinctive interests and personal needs.\nThe project also includes the use of Chromebooks for Education, which provide access to web??s education and collaboration resources: it is useful for teachers, students and administrators, a simple and low cost solution in modern education.\nHandcross Park School moved to using Chromebooks in 2014 when they began provisioning 1:1 Chromebooks for year 5 to year 8 students. In 2018, Handcross Park School deployed 1:1 Acer Chromebook Spin 11 for teachers, allowing them to be more connected and increase mobility.\nPupils at Handcross Park begin to use Chromebooks with a 1:1 ratio of Chromebooks in Year 3-8, having their own personal devices that they are able to use both in the classroom and to aid in schoolwork at home. Handcross Park School has 400 Acer Chromebooks overall (the models are: Acer Chromebook R 11, Acer Chromebook C731 and  Acer Chromebook C740).\n\n\nWhy Handcross Park School chose Acer Chromebooks\n\nSchools needs to provide solutions dedicated for present-day ways of learning and teaching. Kids and teenagers use mobile phones, tablets and notebooks intuitively at home and the education industry has to adapt to encourage young people to learn in a modern way through technology.\nDifferent use cases in school require multiple solutions, which are efficient and adapted to needs, that??s why Handcross Park School chose Acer Chromebook and Google Classroom:\n\n\n??Providing teachers the tools to offer more interactive lessons;\n??Increasing creativity during classes;\n??Pass on feedback from teachers to students.\n\nUsing Google Classroom, children are also able to access online resources and teachers can keep track of students work, post assignments, announcements and quizzes that allow children to work independently and collaboratively with classmates while being easily managed. Staff also have access to Chromebooks as well as stationary desktops in classrooms.\nThe move to Chrome not only allowed the school to transform the way in which lessons are delivered ?V making the sessions more collaborative and interactive ?V but they also had the opportunity to re-utilize the traditional IT rooms to allow for more space for traditional classrooms.\n\n\nFeedback from the teachers\n\nStudents and teachers appreciate the new possibilities offered by using modern devices: classes are more interactive, while tasks and projects are engaging for students. Handcross Park School is creating an environment which is preparing students for life after education through technology.\n??Chromebooks have allowed our pupils to continue enhance their learning in a safe digital environment. The use of Google Education Suite gives teachers the confidence to develop their teaching to not only meet the specific curriculum needs but also meet the future needs of the pupils in our fast developing digital world.?? said Ant Falkus, Deputy Head.\nFreddie Piper, Head of History, stated that: ??The Acer Spin has revolutionized my teaching. Being able to use the touchscreen with a stylus means I can make corrections on work quickly and efficiently without the need to take work in (meaning the pupils are unable to work on it or revise from it until it is returned). The ability to access everything from drive and put it straight into Google Classroom has not only saved me a considerable amount of money on printing but also saved me so much time.??\nIn the end, also Des O??Connor, the IT Co-Ordinator of Handcross Park School, endorsed the choice of Acer Chromebooks, saying that they ??have revolutionised the teaching and learning potential at Handcross Park. As the IT Co-Ordinator I am able to manage four hundred Chromebooks whilst maintaining a teaching timetable because they are so easy to deploy and manage.??\nTo know more about this great success story, watch the full video!'),

Acer Chromebooks. Since then, certain reading assignments are proceeding more effectively and the pupils are picking up on the instructional material more quickly.\n??Our mission is offering suitable instruction that matches up with the children??s development??, says Director Andr? Dunnewind of the Domino primary school. The school is working with the most modern teaching methods: ??Along with a number of pc??s and other digital devices, we now have around 65 Chromebook 11 N7.??\nDunnewind is supported at his school by a team of fifteen teachers, supporting personnel and an internal supervisor. Furthermore, the school has around one hundred pupils and is a part of the VGPO de Oosthoek (Association for Reformed Primary Education). This association consists twelve primary schools spread out over seven communities in Twente and Salland.\nHere are the main benefits that both teachers and students have observed in these Acer Chromebooks, directly from their words.\n\n\nAn optimal support for teachers and students\n\nThe Chromebooks aren??t just a good support for the pupils, but also for us as teachers\n\nConcerning the use of Chromebooks, for which there is a broad spectrum of didactic software available, the advantages mentioned are greater flexibility, decreased work pressure for teachers and the fact that children can adjust the speed of study better to their individual capabilities. How does this work at Domino primary school?\n??The Chromebooks aren??t just a good support for the pupils, but also for us as teachers??, says Heidie Overweg, ??As soon as children in the class start working on their Chromebooks, we as teachers are relieved from work to a certain degree. But it is, of course, not the case that computers can replace teachers. Giving instruction and supervising children is and remains an important part of our profession.??\n\n\nTeachers can monitor what children are doing\n\nThanks to the monitoring function you can correct them directly.\n\n??On my Chromebook, where the monitoring software is activated, I can see what the children are doing??, Overweg continues. ??When children are completing an assignment, you can see through the colour code who is doing well and who still needs help. We can also track the browser history and intervene when necessary if they are looking at sites that are not suitable for children. It??s most of all the ??strong?? pupils who really make a game out of it: they go on too quickly if the material is too easy. Thanks to the monitoring function you can correct them directly.??\n\n\nGet immediate feedback\n\nThe cool thing is that they get direct feedback\n\n??The children who work with Chromebooks are wearing headsets, do their assignments and watch short instructional films. The cool thing is that they get direct feedback?? Overweg emphasizes. ??This is in contrast to before when they did their assignments hand-written which they then handed to the teachers and had to wait to see how their work was graded. The direct relationship between doing an assignment and seeing if the answer is right is good, whether one is working on desktop computer or Chromebook. Most of all it takes the time-consuming grading and correcting of written assignments out of our hands. The downside is that children are writing less and less and that their handwriting is often not the most beautiful. We are trying to do something about this in a separate program.??\n\n\n\nChromebooks are definitely better than laptops\n\nWe find iPads and Android tablets too limited and laptops are too expensive, too heavy and hard to secure. Chromebooks seem ideal.\n\n??The added value of digitally supported instruction is evident. The pc??s which are available to pupils, are also carefully planned in. Along with this we have looked at what our other options are??, says director Dunnewind. ??We find iPads and Android tablets too limited and laptops are too expensive, too heavy and hard to secure. Chromebooks seem ideal. They are compact, light, safe and have a good keyboard and a large screen. In our case it??s a touchscreen. Children are used to this through their smartphones and tablets and they start working with them really quickly.??\nFurthermore, thanks to the cloud educators and pupils have very good educational programs and platforms available for the school. Dunnewind: ??In our school, children learn about numbers on the Chromebooks using ??The World in Numbers?? do language exercises with ??Taal Actief??(Active Language) and as a school we make use of the organisation model ??VierKeerWijzer?? (FourTimesWiser), which allows us to realise customised instruction. With the planning program ??Gynzy??, which is especially made for children we are able to make simple daily schedules for the pupils with, for example, spelling, math and geography exercises.??\n\n\nA good Wi-Fi network is necessary to run all the devices at their finest\n\nEverything is in the cloud, so you have to have a WI-FI network with good coverage.\n\n??Our IT-department has kept a sharp eye on the market and since Acer made us a great offer and has great Chromebooks in its inventory, all pupils in the year 3-4 now have their ??own?? Acer Chromebook??, Dunnewind says of their purchasing process. ??There is no application software in the Chromebooks themselves. Everything is in the cloud, so you have to have a WI-FI network with good coverage. We optimised ours by adding extra support points.??\nThe pupils don?? take the Chromebooks home with them Dunnewind explains: ??We bought special storage cabinets with power outlets. In the evenings the Acers charge up to 100% and the battery life is sufficient for them to make it through the whole school day or even longer. If children want to finish something or look something up at home, they can log in to their accounts with their own pc??s. But we really don??t encourage that. A child also needs time to play outside.??\n??Another advantage of Chromebooks is that children learn to work very accurately??, says Overweg. ??If you want to write a letter or a sentence or an assignment hastily, you have to enter all the letters correctly on a Chromebook, including comma??s and periods. Otherwise the program will mark it wrong. Furthermore, a great plus point is that children with dyslexia, thanks to working on Chromebooks, comprehend things more quickly. This is because there are often short instructional films built into the reading material. Instead of having to read instructions, which, in the case of children with dyslexia is slower and less effective, they can watch a short film with a spoken explanation. If needed, they can watch it twice and then they really get it. But other children also do better with Chromebooks. The final test for year 5-6, which just spent a year working with Chromebooks, has never been so good in the section on punctuation!??\n\n??Both the children and the teachers are unanimously enthusiastic about Chromebooks??, Dunnewind says in conclusion. ??It demands a bit of effort because everything is documented and coded and you have selected the right software and activated it. But on the balance digitally supported instruction, along with taking some of the load off of our teachers, also yields considerably better results with the pupils. For us, the use of Chromebooks is a true success story.??');

Selborne Primary School based in East London decided to partner with Acer to introduce the Google Chromebook as part of their classroom learnings early in 2013. Through the Acer Premier Partner Program, Acer Africa has managed to successfully provide technology solutions to over 120 schools across its network. The success, according to Lacey, lies in the fully customisable solutions that Google and its platforms provide.\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks allowed Selborne Primary School to overcome ??one size fits all?? method\n\nAfter comparing several solutions, Selborne Primary School??s governing board decided that the Google platform will be the best vehicle to move the school into the next phase of its technology journey. Sarah Friend, Grade Seven teacher at Selborne explains that, ??ease of use is probably the stand out feature for me. This allows each pupil to use the device according to their unique learning ability??. And this is what makes the Chromebook unique to any other netbook.\n??The Chromebook supports the learning material of a school??s current curriculum ?V continued Friend ?V while allowing a pupil to expand this learning with additional online tools via the safe and secure Device Management System (DMS) and it??s always up to date??. The robust build of the device and selection of applications allows both educator and pupil to get the most out of the learning process. A recent study supports this claim reporting that more than 60% of students have indicated that their learning experience is enhanced by the Chromebook. ??As an IT administrator of the school, I can manage our Chromebooks, the learning material and other Chrome devices, from a cloud-based Admin console or DMS??, says Friend.\n??Since its introduction to the South African market, late in 2013, the Chromebook has had a clear and lasting value add in the local education sector??, says Alister Payne, MD of Google Cloud Solutions. Payne refers to the advancements of technology in the classroom as Tequity, or Tech Equity: ??Bringing tech into the learning environment creates an enhanced learning experience??. According to Payne, Tequity reaches further than only the physical accessibility of devices, but the convenience of accessing information via a device as well as the simplicity thereof. Technology should never be introduced to a classroom to replace educators, but rather to aid the facilitator to support pupils during the exploration and curation process.\n\n\nStudents are starting to play an active role in the learning process\n\n??This is the future of learning?? says Lacey, ??Students become content creators rather than content consumers??. With a plethora of applications and collaborative tools at their disposal, each student consumes learning material according to their capabilities, making it a lasting experience. ??There are different apps for everything from dissecting a grasshopper to taking a tour through ancient Egypt. Google Chromebook is an essential and interactive tool for the 20th century learner?? says Lacey. By making this paradigm shift more emphasis is placed on exploring and comprehending content rather, than following a graded curriculum based outcome.\nAnother feature that is unique to Google Chromebook is the mobility. Students are able to work on group projects whether they are in the same room or not. Additionally, teachers are also able to evaluate how individuals contributed to group projects. Via the Google Classroom Assignment application, teachers schedule assignments on any subject and are able to track its project. This could be seen as an attempt to get a paperless classroom, creating a greener learning environment.'),

These are the steps taken from the principal, teachers and IT staff:\n\n1. Digitization of the teaching staff: in the first place, great efforts were made to provide all the classrooms with digital whiteboards, while laptops were given to each teacher. This is a two to three-year process that must be complemented with teacher training;\n2. First contact with a tablet: to the traditional computer labs, a portable storage cart with 30 Acer devices was provided. With this, the computer lab stopped to be reserved only for the most digitalized teachers, but all the teachers began to voluntarily use the tablets in their daily activities;\n3. Implementation of the Office 365 environment: e-mail, Word, Excel and PowerPoint complement classrooms tools such as Onenote Classroom, computer lab reservations, Cloud Storage with OneNote, or the possibility of generating evaluations with Forms are some of the many options that Office offers teachers to use at school;\n4. Pilot Class: the ??One to One project?? was implemented in two of the four third-grade classes. On completion, the staff analyzed the academic results and the opinion of the families: the results were very positive;\n5.

Satisfaction surveys are spread among teachers and families.\n\n\nAcer TravelMate Spin B118: an education-built device\n\nAfter starting with several portable storage carts of Acer tablets, teachers immediately bought 50 Acer Aspire Switch 10 devices for two pilot classes. The technical support by Acer was very good, and students were very satisfied with these devices, so the ?rula school kept Acer as supplier, buying TravelMate Spin B118 model, considered an ideal solution for the following reasons:\n\n??it has Windows;\n??its long battery life;\n??its very competitive performance;\n??its rugged and resistant, prepared for the ??classroom;\n??its very good price.\n\n\n\nHow Acer devices overturned the classroom experience\n\nAfter a progressive start-up, improvements in the internet connection and the existence of a very reliable device, the results of the ??One to One?? project have been positive, as confirmed by observing the students?? day-to-day, their opinions and experiences.\nSome of the great changes experienced have been the following:\n\n??Access to information: the student is the protagonist in his learning experience. It is no longer necessary to wait for the contents to be given by the teacher, the book or the library of the school: the student has learned to look for what he needs and to implement it in his daily activities or tasks;\n??Feedback to the teacher: current publishers and digital educative apps provide several information to the teacher, who later can use it to deepen some specific contents. Some of the data that these tools bring are: At what time students make homework, how much time students spend on doing it, how many times they have try and how many students answer one or other question;\n??Communication improvement: applications such as Classdojo, Edmodo or Onenote Classroom have greatly improved communication with students and families. Thanks to them, parents are informed of everything in real-time and students can work together by sharing documents. This has greatly improved their teamwork skills;\n??Digital evaluation: keeping to a large extent traditional evaluation, students have access to much more motivating evaluations. Also, the teacher receives much more information from the tests, spending less time in grading;\n??Flip Classroom: it is one of the most successful methodologies at the school. In the beginning, it was a first step for all teachers to have their own blog. Currently, many teachers are taking a step further by creating their own educational channels where they explain on a playful manner the class content. The students can watch the videos at home as many times as they want and when they finish they fill up a small digital form. The next day, the teacher knows exactly how many students have understood the subject and which sections must be reinforced;\n??Gamification: is there a better way to learn than enjoying the contents? The teachers have observed that students learn more efficiently when they are having a nice time. That??s why they have used numerous tools such as Kahoot or Socrative that serve to generate questions with a competitive nature, or others such as virtual learning environments, or the creation of video games by teachers.'),

To encourage participation and demonstrate what can be achieved, Year 6 students from Christ Church Primary School, Cressage piloted the project by visiting National Trust property Attingham Park to gather content.\n\n\nThe Doomsday Project\n\nThe project encompassed more than just history and technology, with students also learning about collaboration, research and publishing.\nAware that their creations will be available nationally, the students were keen to set the bar and produce the highest quality images possible. This high quality of images also means that they can be accessed through virtually any platform, from low-end VR viewers up to the Microsoft MR headsets.\nTo demonstrate that the project is accessible to all types of school, the only two fixed components used were the Acer MR Headset and the Acer Aspire 7 Laptop. For the image and video editing software, open source editors such as Gimp and Shotcut can be used. Camera-wise, an inexpensive single lens, 360?X camera such as the high quality Acer 360 can be used through to professional devices such as the Vuze multi-lens 4K camera.\nUsing the Engage platform from Immersive VR Education, the library of content gathered can be used by the student creators or other educators to create lessons, for subject support, virtual field trips or themed trails.\n\n\nHow VR can enhance learning experience\n\nThe idea of Mixed Reality technology and applications is a relatively new concept to a small rural school with limited access to technology such as Christ Church Primary. As such the students were initially introduced to the concept of Virtual Reality through a number of applications running on the Acer MR Headset platform.\nAs they were studying Roman history at the time, the students used Microsoft??s Holotour interactive virtual reality app. This lets users explore the City of Rome by flying above the city in a hot air balloon and interactively visit sites such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon as well as witness Gladiators fighting in a Roman arena. ??The project makes history more exciting because it feels like you are actually there and it is quite interactive?? a student said.'),

It is based on a multi linguistic teaching system that gives great importance to new technologies and doing sport from an early age.\n\n\nThe adoption of Acer Chromebooks allowed to renew the IT infrastructure\n\nBefore 2015, students had to bring their laptops to school to be able to use them in class. At that time not all students could afford to take their devices to class, and that hindered the teacher??s job to create fun and entertaining activities using technology. Then, the school bought 60 Acer Chromebooks and, since then, teachers and students have become used to working with computers in the classroom environment, which has enhanced and enriched the lessons due to all the advantages technology provides.\nSpeed was one of the main issues that teachers and students had to face in the past, as standard computers tended to take a couple of minutes to start up, but with Chromebooks, this time is reduced to seconds, which allows to assign a realistic timing into practice sessions.\nToday, Bon Soleil school has 120 Acer chromebooks which each student can use in class, with their unique Google account. That makes it easier for teachers to share content with students using platforms like Google Drive and Google Classroom, setting tasks and deadlines, assessing online and correcting Google documents, giving feedback to their pupils about their different projects, etc.\n\n\nLearning to code thanks to Acer CloudProfessor\n\nTeaching Programming in school has always been a challenge. That is why the Cloud Professor resulted to be the best device to introduce students to the amazing world of Coding and Programming. It allows educators to teach Programming using Arduino Blockly and dive into real code programming with JavaScript. In addition, students can experiment with programming using tablets or smartphones.\nFinally, one of the main advantages that Cloud Professor is its accessibility: being able to easily connect new sensors and actuators to the main board makes building projects much more reliable during school time.\nOn balance, for all these reasons teachers of Bon Soleil strongly believe that working with Acer products is an asset that not only benefits the school community at all levels, but, as an essential learning tool, it also helps them to develop the 21st century way of teaching, where the student discovers and learns in autonomy while the teacher only has to manage the class, which allows students to improve their critical thinking skills, essential skills for success in life.'),

All of them drew their own monster and invented their name: Orange, Greeny, Fire, etc. Then every student learned how to log into in his own account and became a member of the ??Monster Class?? in Google Classroom.\nDuring April and May, the ??little monsters?? started to use their Chromebooks as new tools to participate to daily activities in class. Those activities were focused especially on reading and writing, since they are the main goals for Italian language during the first year of Primary school.\nOpening Google Classroom, the students could find the activity they had to complete in pairs, in small group or individually. I limited the tasks on the use of Google Documents and Google Form. The students have already understood how to share a doc with peers or teachers, using the toolbar and the main rules in typing. Google Forms were used to test them in reading and comprehension: the text was on paper, the questions in digital form.\nThe great advantage of this solution is the fact that I can correct their forms right in front of them, giving an immediate feedback on their work.\n\n\nLearning by gaming, in a safe and secure way\n\nChromebooks were also used to ??play?? and enjoy. I created a number of LAB activities, using SMART Notebook software, to teach through game-based learning methodology. They were engaged in their learning through games related to the content of the week, mainly Italian writing. It was a success because they asked to play with them in their free time.\nAs we went on using our devices, we also learned the important rules to get the most from them without any risk. It means I taught them ??Digital Citizenship??, the basic rules to protect ourselves and respect the others while using the net.\nRather than telling them what to do, I approached the contents, both Italian and Digital Citizenship, asking them to solve a problem, find or invent something together. I didn??t want to be the expert in the use of the device, I privileged the peer collaboration or the personal discovery that can be shared with the community.\nWe are at the beginning of this project, but till now it has been really helpful because it has changed the way of learning for the students and the role of the teacher: from the person who knows to the person who helps and shares.'),

Thus, they want feedback on how well their product provides charging services and how easy it is to distribute devices from the cart. Also, comments on the safety of the cart are encouraged.\n\n\nThe results of this pilot study\n\nThis pilot study started in early June 2017, and the results are really satisfying so far: the one occurred in the International School of Vantaa was a digital revolution. Each classroom has enough Acer Chromebooks, and the renovated goal is to help students gain digital competency for their future studies and careers.

They have managed to get students to write more and produce better quality texts.\nFurthermore, the Lockncharge cart is a good safe storage for the devices. The baskets are a novel way of getting the devices distributed to the students. There were some issues with the cables as they tend to get tangled easily but, everall, the system deployment was successful.\n\n\nWhat??s next for the organization?\n\nThe future entails that the if the system implemented in the Internation School of Vantaa will be successful, it will be recommended to the city to be added to their catalogue as a fully integrated ICT solution for schools still in need of an ICT solution to implement the new Finnish curriculum: the training for device management and use could also be sold as part of the solution. In fact, to guarantee the perfect functioning of this ICT solution and its efficient use, also an adequate skills training should be provided with.'),

In preschool and elementary level, there was only partial WiFi coverage and restricted use of the tablet in the classroom (only up to one hour per day). Furthermore, parent involvement was not a sure thing: a questionnaire distributed at the beginning of the project revealed that around 40% of the parents were afraid that ?V because of these technological devices ?V students would study less and be distracted within the classroom.\n\nAt the pedagogy level, the school decided to adopt the Flipped Classroom as a model and the school started to slowly increment technology in the relationship between teachers and students:\n??Video-lessons with key concepts for students to access prior to class, and classroom activities on teacher-student interactivity\n??Computer programming activities and educational robotics as a school project for levels K-15, framed by a storytelling approach\n??Occasional initiatives with Skype\n??New Office 365 tools explored: Outlook, OneNote, Sway and Yammer.\n\nA survey, answered by almost 500 parents in the beginning of the second school year, revealed that 98% of them were very happy with TeK.escolaglobal project.\n\n\n2nd year\n\nIn the 2016/2017 school year, the administration decided to deploy identical laptops for all school levels and to increase the investment in the technological infrastructure, by providing a complete WiFi coverage in the whole school environment.\nAs device, we chose Acer TravelMate Spin B118 because it??s perfect for our teaching methods: its rugged design and its versatility, combined with a battery life of up to 13 hours, are fundamental features that empower student exploration and achievement.\nFurthermore, the school also decided to explore Project-Based Learning as an overall school practice: students had to develop a project geared towards increasing sustainable tourism in the region, with all courses involved in the project activities with interdisciplinary exercises. Throughout the year, over 20 different activities were organized by students outside the school to promote local touristic spot.\nAt the facilities level, following teachers?? requests, it was created the Collaborative Innovation Lab (CoIL), a new building equipped with flexible furniture and technological devices, following the recommendations of the Future Classroom Lab (FCL) initiative of European Schoolnet.\n\n\n\n3rd year\n\nIn the end of the 2016/2017 school year, we were asked by Microsoft Portugal to allow a team of teachers to go to Microsoft Copenhagen (Denmark) for training at the STEM SUMMER SCHOOL 2017, focusing on teaching approaches to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).\nThe school started using CoIL for elementary and middle school to conduct both classes on traditional topics and on a new combined curricular unit on STEM. Following the teachers?? summer school participation, a new pedagogical project was started in the beginning of this year in which all K-15 students have a space in their schedule to develop real projects integrating the STEM areas.\nWe also implemented a gamified strategy in which students belong to teams and for each challenge or class project teachers give points to the team. Each week students get an update their score and the school ranking: at the end of the term, students get a card with their final score and that puts them in a bronze, silver or golden category. With this methodology, we saw students more motivated, especially those with poor results in written tests. For each of the school terms, students and teachers explored different tools: Paint 3D, Micro:bit and Microsoft Minecraft.\nAnd this is our story: the story of how the use of technology was embraced by Escola Global??s teachers with the goal of enhancing interactivity and student participation. It??s now clear that it is important to prioritize dynamic learning over rote learning, making students active contributors, by experiencing, making, and creating educational contents, showing new skills and critical thinking in a real-world experiences and different contexts.'),

But when you finally succeed and see the children using it?K that??s very satisfying.??\n\n\nA common starting point: an unsuitable IT infrastructure\n\nPreviously, the IT department of Juliana School had included different types of notebook, all of them with a detachable keyboard, and those had turned out to be too fragile for use at school. Beacause children are simply accident prone, and because the notebooks could literally be taken apart, problems arose faster than expected.\nAccordingly, the Juliana School needed laptops ideal to be used by many students and in many places, even in a single day: first of all, these laptops had to be highly resistant, and features such as touch screen and convertible design would be considered as an important added value.\nFor all these reasons, the choice of the Juliana School IT department felt on Acer TravelMate Spin B1, and during the second quarter of 2017, the Juliana School purchased 96 of them.\n\n\nA revolution in the Juliana School learning experience\n\nThe selection process that led to the Acer TravelMate B118 went pretty smoothly, according to Van Dijk. She says: ??We have an IT committee consisting of five teachers. First we determined what we actually wanted to do with them. One of the most important aspects was that the laptops had to be sturdy, ??vandal proof?? as we say. Furthermore, it had to be a mobile system, so desktop PCs were out of the question. And there had to be a physical keyboard, because most work simply requires keyboard input. Finally, we use software that requires a touch screen??.\nThe Acer TravelMate B118 was proposed by Emjee ICT diensten, the Juliana School IT supplier, and resulted to be the perfect answer to Juliana School needs: ??The TravelMate Spin B1 is incredibly robust and has a system in the keyboard that prevents damage from liquid spills. The moisture just runs out at the bottom. That is ideal,?? says Van Dijk enthusiastically. ??The screen flips around all the way to the back, so it can be used in all different positions and for all kinds of purposes. We currently have eight for each classroom, about one for every three children. These three children are then jointly responsible for a specific notebook that has their names on it. You can see that the notebooks are now much better cared for??.\nThanks to a teacher??s father, who does woodworking as a hobby, the Juliana School has also found a creative solution for storage and recharging: he made a special storage system for every class, in which the laptops can be collected, stored and charged. This original storage system is very neat and organized, and super easy for the pupils to use: they put the notebooks in the rack and connect the charging cable. Because the charging lights remain visible, each student can see at a glance whether all the notebooks are charged.\n\n\nThe main benefits from Acer TravelMate for Juliana School students and teachers\n\nVan Dijk summarizes why she is so happy with the Acer TravelMate B118: ??It meets all our wishes and requirements. That??s a nice starting point. It starts quickly, which is certainly a must in education with a class full of impatient children. Our IT partner emjee ICT diensten has created a special login procedure for us, enabling the laptops to boot without first having to be logged into the school network at the server. The children log in via Wi-Fi directly to their own Office 365 account which contains links to the required software.\nAt the end of the day teachers no longer have to actively check as much of the work, because the software helps. That could help reduce the workload in the long term??.\n??What will the future bring? Ultimately we want to start working with Acer Classroom Manager and use digital processing software instead of books and paper. A dot on the horizon is therefore a notebook for every child, to make our education even better and to work on 21st-century skills??.'),

Motivation, Innovation, and Technology as the Key Elements in the Teaching Process?? aimed at enhance student motivation to study hard through employing innovative teaching techniques. ??We hope to transform our school into an institution where teaching passion translates into learning passion; a place where both teachers and students develop an attitude open to and welcoming international contacts and cooperation, breaking through the language and cultural barriers??, says the Rybnik school Principal. ??This novel teaching approach will produce better results at the graduation exams and thus make it easier for the student to begin adult life??.\n\n\nHow to overtake an inadequate IT infrastructure\n\nFocusing on young people??s intellectual development by involving them in international projects and creating new opportunities, the School realized that the existing IT infrastructure proved inadequate in the everyday work:\n\n??school administration used private email addresses and phones;\n??contacts among teachers and students?? parents was limited to traditional correspondence and face-to-face meetings;\n??the electronic class register was added barely five years earlier;\n??the students worked individually, each on their own computer in the computer lab, with no server to log in and share files\n\nTo make matters worse, the school did not have its own IT administrator, so the IT teacher had to handle all such situations. So the Principal started looking for a solution that would not only streamline cooperation and information flow but ?V at the same time ?V not require advanced IT knowledge or experience to operate the equipment.\n\n\nA new way to learn, thanks to Acer Chromebooks\n\nAlong with Seiloc Enterprise Solutions and Acer, No 4 High School has found in Acer Chromebooks ?V and in Google technology overall ?V the essential communication and cooperation tools to boost its strategy.\nHere are some examples of how Google technologies helped teachers and administration to overcome the unsuitableness of the previous IT infrastructure:\n\n??Gmail, integrated with Calendar and a shared disk, has made it possible for the administration personnel and the teaching staff to communicate safely and smoothly, with personal messages clearly separated from the business ones;\n??Hangouts Meet, a new solution for video chats and video conferencing, provides smooth, problem-free contact with their peers in other countries;\n??G Suite for Education apps for creating documents and presentations have proved very handy both for the students and teachers, simplifying group works on shared projects and reports, while also teaching team work at the same time.\n\nMoreover, new language labs have now acquired Acer Chromebooks and the mobile devices have made it possible for teachers to use them during other classes.\n\n\nThe main benefits from Acer Chromebooks in the internal communication\n\nThe introduction of Chromebooks and G Suite for Education tools has contributed to strongly streamlining communication between teachers and students. Chromebooks have successfully solved the tangled problem of complicated computer administration: now, any teacher can easily do it. Google Documents, Presentations, and Forms make class or school project evaluation easy and simple, while Calendar simplifies the planning of school activities, with ready access for all the users.\nThe new technology has also provided an opportune impulse for the teaching staff to further improve their technical skills. Contacts with the students have been made easier, accompanied by a new option of remote homework and remote testing, so that students can now submit their assignments to teachers using the Google Disk.\nThe desire to improve the teaching process by incorporating brand new technologies was the driving force behind the implementation of the new technology. Chrome Technology and G Suite for Education have well served the purpose, allowing for successful completion of all the outlined objectives. Today, teachers and students discover new areas of the new technology application, developing their creativity and enjoying the new opportunities opening before them.'),

The teachers and the students body of ISK comprise a unique, multicultural environment: at the present time, there are approximately 300 students ranging from 3 to 19 years of age and hailing from over 30 countries attend the school.\n\n\nHow to overcome an old and inadequate IT infrastructure\n\nThe dynamic growth of the school over the last few years had rendered the existing IT infrastructure inadequate for its needs. Just two modest computer labs equipped with stationary hardware had been available to the students. They were expensive to maintain, prone to breakdowns, and very time-intensive to operate. The insufficient number of units also necessitated that lab time slots be reserved in advance, which represented yet another critical hindrance.\nFaced with such challenges, the school decided to look for a mobile solution which would be light, reliable, and more economical to maintain.\n\n\nThe solution has come from Acer and Seiloc\n\nTogether with ISK??s IT team and administration, Seiloc Enterprise Solutions and Acer created a solution to address the IT needs of the International School of Krakow by proposing that the existing infrastructure would be replaced with a Chrome family application.\nSeiloc supplied light Acer Chromebooks measuring 13?? and 14?? for use by all students, beginning with the third grade and all the way up to the high school senior class.\nG Suite for Education tools allowed the school to eliminate the need for maintaining an expensive server room and instead use the Cloud for the storage of educational materials and student files. Students can now use the 1:1 and 2:1 model equipments for any class, which provide them with uninterrupted access to word processing programs needed for composing essays, preparing class presentations, and other such projects or assignments.\n\n\nHow teaching has benefited from Acer Chromebooks\n\nISK has benefited prodigiously from its collaboration with Seiloc and the resulting implementation of Chrome Technology: Acer Chromebooks have evolved into some of the essential educational tools that the school offers: they support language instruction and allow for exams to be both written and subsequently taken online, in addition to a number of other uses.\nThe headaches of maintaining burdensome computer labs have disappeared, replaced now by devices which students are able to use in ways they find most convenient and productive to them. \nInstead of procuring printed teaching materials, faculty members now share the files with their students directly via a Shared Disk. Teachers no longer need to worry that desktop units may malfunction while in use in class as their students have gained reliable access to light, state-of-the-art devices.\nIn addition to the aforementioned benefits, the conversion to Chrome Technology has resulted in advancing the technical competencies of the student body and faculty, allowing the school to keep pace with the standards of world class education.\nTo know more about this success story, watch this video:'),

They are more creative, critical, and autonomous, as they learn to take advantage of their time.\nIn the case of Santa Mar?a Marianists School, educators were looking for technology capable of boosting work flow as well as other skills that have little to do with technology. One of the school??s aims is to fully integrate technology into the classroom so it becomes second nature. Educators hope to move from paper-based work to computer-based in a natural process.\nAt the end of the 2014-15 school year, a pilot test was conducted with Aspire R11 through Xenon Computer. That same year, Santa Mar?a Marianistas School acquired several units for its 5th grade class with the aim of integrating Windows Pro in all subjects (Science, Mathematics, Euskera, Spanish, Art, English ?K). This project provides to each students one personal device with access to their data in a fast and agile way, under the control of their teachers.\n\nThe performance of students increased and the school decided to renew the equipment with the model Acer TravelMate Spin B118 (about 350 systems installed in the first two years of the project). These devices gave them reliability and functionality in equal parts, since they are set up with agile processors. This feature, combined with the solid-state drive of the TravelMate Spin B118 makes the equipment easy to turn on and off throughout a class. In addition, its touch screen in 360 degrees opened more possibilities for the students.\nThese devices were also chosen for their Windows Pro and its Microsoft Office 365 tools: opens a range of possibilities through programs such as Themes, One Note, OneNote Class or Planner, which reinvents the processes inside the school ?V both for teachers and administration ?V and yields improvement in the way of communicating, collaborating and managing information.\nThe choice of Acer TravelMate Spin B118 was the most suitable for older primary students.

The devices will go to Buluga Primary School, a partner institution in a rural area that caters to disadvantaged children who may see the start of their very own IT centre thanks to this donation, which will make their school a place from which they can connect to the wider online world and access opportunities that their isolation would have otherwise denied.\n\n\nNew English School, Kuwait\n\nIn an area where environmental concerns are not yet very widespread, New English School shines as the largest school recycling centre in the country, with over a tonne of recycled material a month. From recycling paper and plastic in the classroom, to cleaning up beaches, to developing an eco-friendly conscience alongside their students?? business sense by giving them the opportunity to lead a recycling company whose profits are given back to the community, New English School was the perfect place to partner with the charity organization Direct Aid so that the prize can benefit the under-privileged students in Africa who had already been receiving textbooks and supplies from them.\n\nAn honourable mention goes to Szko?a Podstawowa nr 2, Poland, which will also be receiving a special prize for their charitable, multicultural activity consisting of fostering online communication between their own pupils and their peers in Uganda and providing them with school supplies.');

The collective effort for a greener world starts from individual responsibility: each of us can make a number of small gestures that leave a greater mark on the environment, for better or for worse, than many realise.\nHowever, major companies have the power, and therefore the duty, to help citizens make the right choices when it comes to preserving the environment, and Acer has answered the call for more sustainable products in a world that needs everyone??s help to face the threat of climate change.\n\n\nLive smarter, live healthier\n\nWith the help of its subsidiary companies, Acer is striving to make city life smarter and eco-friendly: from batteries for electric bicycles that can connect to your phone for real-time info on battery status, ride time, position and speed, to e-ticketing systems to streamline and promote public transport, up to electric cars with an autonomous driving system, Acer is working hard to ensure that in the cities of the future, mobility will be accessible to everyone with minimal impact on the environment. Acer??s research and development is looking in the direction of a world where public transportation is an attractive choice, made easier and more efficient by the latest technological solutions, and personal vehicles, where necessary, contribute as little as possible to air pollution. Thanks to technology, smart cities can produce smarter citizens, and our planet will thank us for it.\nIn accordance with the United Nations?? Sustainable Development Goals, technology can even be used to promote public health and guarantee a better quality of life for disadvantage categories such as the disabled, the elderly, and the chronically ill: epidemic monitoring and prevention through big data and AI, chronic disease management in the workplace, easier implementation of social welfare, VR training to help people with disabilities get started in the job market, and encouraging blood donations through smartphone apps are only some of the ways Acer is planning to use technology for a healthier world.\nHowever, personal health means little when Earth as a whole is suffering, and Acer is implementing strategies to reduce the influence of its activities on the planet. Here are some examples of what we are doing to ensure that the next generation will inherit a world that is greener than we found it.\n\n\nCycle & Recycle\n\nOne of Acer??s greatest goals is to minimise the impact of its products on the environment. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, from increasing the efficiency of said products?? energy usage, to striving for a circular economy model?Xthat is, prolonging the life cycle of products with design choices that encourage repair and refurbishing as opposed to creating e-waste, and being part of the chain of recycling by reusing and remanufacturing parts and using recycled materials to begin with. Acer is contributing to the creation of more and more locations for the collection and reuse of lithium batteries, which decreases the need for raw cobalt for the production of new ones, thereby making the world not only a less polluted place, but also fairer and more humane, as cobalt mining has a worrying correlation with child labour.\nAcer cares for the environment at every stage of production, from the design of a new product to the natural end of its useful life: recycling makes the beginning and the end of the process eco-friendly, but there are plenty more ways to make sure Acer products leave as small a mark as possible on planet Earth. From restricting the use of potentially harmful chemicals in the raw materials used in their design to rethinking their packaging, we are striving to ensure that buying Acer products is an all-around safe choice for environmentally conscious users. A simple solution sometimes goes a long way: Acer has been using recycled paper and reducing package sizes so that not only the product, but even the box it comes in is eco-friendly. Smaller, lighter packaging also results in increased shipping efficiency, which ?V coupled with environmentally savvy choices in the means of transportation we employ, favouring rail and maritime shipping over air shipping ?V means less fuel has been used to deliver your Acer product to your doorstep.\n\n\n\nPreventing climate change\n\nProduct shipping is only a fraction of the activities with which a company inevitably influences the environment: from staff travel to usage of energy and water, every aspect of the work behind your Acer computer can still be improved for the sake of our planet. Becoming eco-friendly is a constant work in progress that can be accomplished step by step, by setting realistic aims and enlisting everyone??s help in our mission to save the environment.\nAcer??s mid-term goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2020, with the ultimate objective of bringing that figure up to 80% by 2050 ?V the carbon reduction target is compared with the base year 2009. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, the chief strategy being to promote the use of green electricity in all our facilities worldwide: all work requires energy, but not all energy has the same environmental impact. By switching gradually to wind and solar power and disincentivizing the use of natural gas and combustion, we are actively striving to make our carbon footprint smaller.\nAs well as reducing the impact of our production activities, we are also taking measures to ensure that the everyday life of Acer employees is environmentally conscious. Online meetings, for example, cut down on the need to travel: a video conference damages the planet far less than boarding a plane. Simple strategies such as improving the efficiency of air conditioning and lighting in our office buildings, reusing and recycling water for our employees?? personal uses, and implementing ways to discourage waste production can go a long way in making Acer an eco-friendly company. In our facilities, we frown upon disposable cutlery and bags, have discontinued the offering of bottled water in conference areas, promote trash sorting and recycling, and favour digital documents over printing?Xall small steps towards a greener world, seemingly insignificant by themselves, but much more meaningful when combined.\nFrom single employees to overall company policies, Acer is working at all levels to make the world a more sustainable place?Xnow it is your turn to do the same.\nTo get more info, learn more about Acer Corporate Social Responsibility.'),

Without human inventiveness, none of the technology that makes our lives easier would exist, and without people to make the most of them, companies like Acer, that make a positive impact on the world through technological solutions, would have no reason to be.\nThat is why, now more than ever, people are at the core of Acer??s mission. We have the power to shape a better future by giving back to the global community in ways that go beyond providing the latest technologies, and with that power comes the responsibility to work actively towards creating better lives for humankind.\nAcer Humanity is the ultimate expression of Acer??s aim to make technology more human: let??s have a closer look at what it is and why it is of vital importance.\n\n\nA better world for everyone\n\nThe short-term goal of Acer Humanity is to renew Acer??s focus on two main areas that can give a significant contribution to the creation of a better world to live in: education and the environment. Education is the key to our future: it has always been Acer??s objective to spread knowledge, break barriers between technology and people, and inspire each other to make a difference, and a combination of technology and generosity is the unique recipe that makes Acer a leading force in bringing more accessible and innovative learning environments to young people in disadvantage countries while simultaneously being good for our planet. With the creation of digital learning centres in areas that would otherwise struggle to provide education to their children and charity projects combining ecology and education, such as raising funds for new educational equipment by gathering e-waste, technology, education and the environment have never gone hand in hand more than today.\nIn our age of pollution and climate catastrophes, the impact of a good education goes far beyond theoretical knowledge and can and should have a tangible influence on our lives. It is becoming clear that an educated world is a greener world. More and more, young people are proving that the environment is one of their greatest concerns, and a generation with fair, equal and efficient access to education can not only learn about the importance of preserving our planet, but also be prepared to come up with innovative solutions to the environmental problems their predecessors have created.\n\n\nGame On, Green On! Are you up to the challenge?\n\nProtecting the environment is a challenge we should all accept, and just like a game, it is a series of concrete steps towards a final goal: that is why Acer is challenging itself to take action through a series of EMEA-wide initiatives and seeking to educate its own employees, not just the younger generation, on what they can do both as a company and as individuals to bring about the change our planet needs if it is to remain liveable.\nThe environmental philosophy of Acer Humanity is a fresh new take on an age-old saying: ??One effort a day takes the barriers of education away??. Repairing the damage to our planet is not something that can be done instantly, but rather a long-term project that no one on Earth is too small to contribute to. At higher levels, Acer has taken action by reducing packaging, favouring the use of renewable energy with the end goal of reducing emissions by 60% by 2020, and establishing recycling centres in three continents to cut down on waste, but we also believe in making a big difference in small ways: while multinational companies have the means and motive to make a strong impact on the environment, each and every one of us can be a part of the driving force behind a better, greener Earth simply by changing our daily habits: recycling and picking up plastic waste, using water more efficiently, fighting deforestation by planting trees, and using conference calls and environmentally friendly transportation instead of contributing to CO? emissions every time we travel long distances are only a few examples of what Acer Humanity is encouraging employees to do.\nMedia outlets are often quick to blame major companies for the state of our planet, but with Acer Humanity, Acer has become part of the solution, not part of the problem.\nAll games have a final prize, and the prize in the global game of preserving the environment is ensuring the continuation of all living species, including our own: the stakes are high, but we have the right tools at our disposal. The game is on?Xwill you be a player too?'),

Helping institutions like the Dubai Autism Centre means to concretely address social issues that affects equality in education, by spreading knowledge about the great role charity plays in integrating children with diseases into the community.\nThe Dubai Autism Centre was founded in 2001 with the aim of providing a better life for children with Autism in the UAE. What kind of services does the Centre provide? It gives comprehensive and specialised support to children with autism, in accordance with the international standards. Moreover, the Dubai Autism Centre also focuses its efforts on providing various educational and therapeutic services to its students by developing Individual Education Plans (IEP??s) to ensure a custom-made assistance.'),

Formerly known as Bing Chat, Microsoft Copilot is actually a family of, well, Copilots. These Copilots have a variety of applications including the enterprise oriented Copilot for Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Copilot for Sales.\n\nToday, we??re going to focus on how a next-generation AI productivity tool, namely Copilot in Windows, promises to redefine education in the classroom. Read on to discover seven ways that Copilot for education can help students and teachers to improve their learning journeys by being their education copilot.\n\n\n1. Efficient Lesson Planning\n\nUnfortunately, many teachers these days are overworked. According to a survey by the RAND Corporation, teachers work an estimated 53 hours a week, that??s seven hours more than the average working adult! Much of these working hours, including time spent planning lessons and marking papers is unpaid, creating a burden of stress that can lead to burnout. Thankfully, Copilot for Word can reduce lesson planning time: Copilot responds to prompts and creates lesson plans, quizzes, rubrics, and other class resources that can be tailored by the teacher to meet students?? needs. What??s more, Copilot can suggest activities, resources, and assessments aligned with educational objectives, streamlining the lesson planning process. By harnessing the power of Copilot, educators can save time and energy, allowing them to focus their energy on engaging with students, and adapting their teaching methods.\n\nSuggested prompt: ??Create a 60 minute lesson plan on the English Civil War for an 11th grade history class.??\n\n\n2. Personalized Learning\n\nImagine a never-tiring assistant who is always happy to rewrite, tweak and customize your writing and content. Well Microsoft Copilot for Word and PowerPoint is a never-tiring assistant that??s ready to work 24/7. Copilot saves teachers a great deal of time in crafting content and feedback that resonates with individual student needs and learning styles. Even if they work all hours under the sun, and burn a bit of that midnight oil too, many teachers today simply don??t have enough time to create educational content that is tailored to meet the diverse needs of all of their students. By leveraging generative AI, Copilot can adapt to different student profiles and provide tailored support to students of all levels. By providing personalized learning experiences, Copilot enhances student engagement, understanding, and retention of material.\n\nSuggested prompt: ??Create spelling worksheets for 9th grade students with three levels of difficulty.??\n\n\n3. High-Quality Educational Materials\n\nIn the age of the internet, artificial intelligence, fake news, and social media, surely it is the duty of every educator to ensure that the educational materials that they give their students are of the highest-quality possible? Once again, time is of the essence, and many teachers simply lack the time to consistently produce high quality educational materials. Copilot to the rescue! Fortunately, Copilot is able to create a wide range of consistent and high-quality educational materials including class notes, summaries, and even study guides. The use of Copilot for teachers in producing high-quality educational materials benefits both teachers and students by ensuring reliable resources are readily available. What??s more, educators can easily maintain access to well-structured content while reducing their workload.\n\nSuggested prompt: ??Create a summary of Hamlet in 300 words.??\n\n\n4. Innovative Teaching Approaches\n\nInnovation is at the forefront of education today. From interactive learning experiences, to hybrid, remote, and even flipped learning, the days of rote learning and chalkboards are numbered! Educators must take the plunge and innovate, but it??s not always easy, or practical to get started. Thankfully, Copilot can be a useful tool that encourages educators to explore new teaching methods. Copilot can alleviate the drudgery of everyday tasks, such as administrative tasks, plagiarism detection, and data analysis. By handing these routine tasks over to Copilot, educators have more time to experiment with innovative approaches in the classroom. Easier said than done, perhaps? Well a real life example of how Copilot can be leveraged effectively is in Wichita Public Schools. They have leveraged Copilot to personalize learning, resulting in time savings that can be reinvested in student support.\n\nSuggested prompt: ??Rewrite page 5 of this PDF, using academic language.??\n\n\n\n5. Accessibility and Inclusion\n\nIncreasing the accessibility and inclusivity of educational content is a groundbreaking feature of Copilot for students. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to education, and Copilot can be a lifeline for students with diverse requirements. Traditionally, learners with visual impairments would make the most of class time by sitting at the front of the classroom to see what was happening on the board, or screen. With Copilot, accessibility features are effortlessly integrated into the learning experience. Accessibility is delivered by generating alt text for images, ensuring content is legible for students with visual impairments. Many classrooms today are multilingual spaces, where learners have varying levels of English, and different mother tongues. Copilot can accurately and efficiently translate to and from many languages, facilitating the creation of materials in multiple languages, making education more inclusive for diverse student populations.\n\nSuggested prompt: ??Translate this task into Spanish??\n\n\n6. Professional Development for Teachers\n\nAs teachers, we want what??s best for our students as we guide them on their learning journeys. At the same time, it??s important for teachers in all fields to stay up to date with teaching and learning developments. Copilot supports a community of continuous learning and professional growth for educators by assisting them in researching educational best practices, and more. In practice, through data analysis and machine learning algorithms, Copilot locates areas where teachers can improve their instructional practice, providing personalized recommendations. With tailored, relevant resources, educators are able to continuously develop their teaching practice, as well as collaborate with others, by sharing everything from lesson plans to classroom insights.\n\nSuggested prompt: ??Add differentiated instruction to this lesson plan.??\n\n\n7. Safe and Responsible AI\n\nWith cyber attacks and ransomware on the rise, safety and security of student and organizational information are paramount. The information that we share with AI needs to be safely and responsibly used and stored, whether it??s handing over lesson planning duties to Copilot, organizing student data, or simply asking general questions. Microsoft is committed to responsible AI practices, and privacy-preserving machine learning. What this means for users is that teacher, student, as well as organizational data are protected. What??s more, chat prompts and responses are not saved or used for training large language models. Ensuring that your data is safe adds peace of mind to users and organizations, and Copilot??s commitment to privacy and security sure makes it a reliable tool for educational settings.\n\n\nThe takeaway\n \nWe hope that you??ve enjoyed today??s educational adventure, and along the way have learned how Copilot in Windows will redefine education in the classroom. While it??s still early days for AI integrated education, teachers and students worldwide are already benefiting greatly from Copilot. From aiding educators in efficiently planning personalized, high-quality lessons, to discovering innovative teaching techniques, the potential application of Copilot are many. Accessibility and inclusion are also a key benefit that Copilot brings to the classroom, as well as the ability to help teachers in continuous professional development. Finally, remember that your data is in safe hands with Copilot, thanks to Microsoft??s commitment to ethical AI.

While implementing robust cybersecurity protocols is essential for leveraging effective technologies, their efficacy remains limited unless integrated into the organizational structure of the institution.\n\nFurthermore, a holistic approach to cybersecurity must recognize the pivotal role of individuals. A secure digital environment is only attainable if all stakeholders commit to reinforcing best practices with consistent awareness and diligence.\n\n\nBeyond the basics: advanced cybersecurity for teachers\n\nAdvanced cybersecurity strategies for teachers encompass several key elements3:\n\nIntegrating Threat Intelligence feeds into your cybersecurity framework to stay ahead of emerging risks.\nUsing Behavioral Analytics to detect anomalies in user and network behavior.\nAdopting a Zero-trust Architecture, especially in remote work scenarios, by requiring authentication from everyone accessing network resources.\nLeveraging Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to strengthen endpoint security.\nPromoting Cloud Security best practices, especially for businesses migrating to cloud environments.\n\n\nFostering cyber hygiene and a cyber-aware community within schools\n\n\nFostering cyber hygiene and cultivating a cyber-aware community within schools is crucial in today??s digital age. A good cybersecurity program should involve students, teachers, and staff.4 Here are some key aspects all educational institutions should consider: \n\nSchools should educate their community with training programs tackling all best practices and awareness campaigns to stress the importance of the topic. \nAll institutions should establish clear cybersecurity policies to ensure that the entire community is updated and aligned on which practices to put in place. \nParents should participate in the community effort, especially in primary education, as the school network integrates with all home networks through student devices. \n\nOverall, although some institutions may struggle to keep up with the rapid innovation of the digital realm and its threats, there is a growing awareness of the topic. Ultimately, investing in cybersecurity in schools not only protects valuable assets but also prepares students for the realities of an increasingly digital world, empowering them to navigate cyberspace safely and responsibly.\n\n\nSources: \n1. ??K-12 Report: CIS MS-ISAC Cybersecurity Assessment of the 2022?V2023 School Year.??

Equipped with the right companions, teachers are able to fulfill all students?? needs. And managing classes has become easier than ever before.\n\nNow, Acer Chromebooks bring that to the next level. What really makes the difference is ChromeOS, the operating system that uses cloud-based technology for automatic background updates to ensure a reliable and secure device.\n\nDesigned to be highly efficient, Chromebooks upgrade the teaching experience and boost productivity thanks to their flexibility, durability, and high level of customization. \n\nKeep reading to find out why you should use Acer Chromebooks in your school!\n\n\nAcer Chromebooks: designed with teachers in mind\n\nYour next device should fit your teaching style. With Chromebooks, teachers can choose from a broad range of tools, features, and capabilities for a totally customizable experience. \n\nThe extensive choice of models includes convertibles, a 3:2 display ratio, and wide-screen Chromebooks, but also further complementary features such as a touch screen, built-in camera, or stylus pens.\n\nNot to mention their eco-friendly features. All Acer Chromebooks ship with 100% recycled packaging. Plus, Chromeboos such as the Vero 712 and the Vero 514 feature eco-friendly components such as Post-Consumer Recycled Plastics and ocean-bound OceanGlass? touchpads. In other words, they??re ready for the classroom, but also for the planet!\n\n\nChromeOS: easy device and class management \n\nAcer Chromebooks offer you the advantage of dealing with a perceptive OS that enhances the full potential of your device. \n\nThanks to Google Workspace for Education, the school community can work from the same interface, while the cloud stores files and recorded lessons securely without storage space worries. \n\nAlso, creating content and delivering it to your classes is easier than ever: teachers can do it all from one device with built-in apps like Screencast, Canvas, or Cursive and use Google Workspace to manage lessons and assignments. \n\nFurthermore, Chromebook devices assure 55% fewer unplanned outages, 73% less time to reboot, 59% less time spent on maintenance, and 76% less frequent rebooting, avoiding interruption and ensuring all school time is used on education rather than troubleshooting.\n\nWhat??s best, our Chromebooks are equipped with up to the latest 13th Gen Intel? Core? i7 processors that help you stay productive and boost your teaching to unprecedented heights. \n\nAnd if the deployment of a large number of Chromebooks for your school sounds scary, forget about it. ChromeOS?? Zero-touch enrollment allows ITs to drop ship newly purchased devices straight into the school network without any manual configuration?Xall it takes is an internet connection. \n\n\nSecurity and durability\n\nToday, internet users are exposed to multiple cyber threats that could harm students and school data. With that in mind, Acer Chromebooks ensure multilayered security for files and data without the need for third-party antivirus software. Security is simply built-in.\n\nHowever, security doesn??t concern web navigation exclusively, especially in an active environment such as schools, where devices must be fast, rugged, and durable to survive classroom life at best. \n\nAcer Chromebooks come with lightning-fast boot-up times, rapid charging, and long battery life to keep up the pace of teaching and maximize time management. Moreover, durable and repairable components, including spill-proof keyboards, scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass, and an average eight-year lifespan, make sure that your device won??t give up on you soon. \n\nLastly, not even a faulty internet connection should worry you: the offline mode will let you and your class update and work on documents nonetheless.\n\n\nFind the best Acer solution for your classroom\nWould you like to upgrade your school tech to be up-to-date with the latest trends in education and technology?

Keep reading to get the hang of CBE and discover its characteristics.\n\n\nWhat is Competency-based education?\n\nCompetency-based education is a continuously-evolving framework for teaching and learning that began to take form decades ago. This efficient approach assesses what students have actually learned and to what extent they are able to put it into practice. \n\nWhat??s best is that students can advance at their own pace, regardless of the educational environment or pre-determined timeframes.\n\n\nHistory of competency-based education\n\nThe Journal of Competency-Based Education traces CBE??s roots back to the USA in the 1970s, where it was first implemented in vocational education programs. \n\nEver since, it has steadily increased in popularity among US universities first and then worldwide.\n\n\nThe benefits of competency-based education\nAccording to the traditional education \nframework, institutions require students to demonstrate mastery of a subject to earn a grade within a time frame, such as a semester. Contrarily, the architecture of CBE differs because learners complete courses as soon as they??ve proven mastery of the material.\n\nThe benefit to students is clear: time saved by completing courses early can be parlayed into pursuing other educational or personal experiences. And because most CBE takes place online, the opportunities are widely within reach.\n\nThere is great potential in Competency-based learning. A self-paced approach tailored to diverse learning abilities can lead to more efficient outcomes and enriching educational experiences.\n\n\nDifferences between Competency-based education and Outcome-based education\n\nAlthough both rely on outcomes, CBE and Outcome-based education differ in many ways.\n\nOutcome-based education focuses predominantly on learning outcomes or goals. In this approach, the curricula are geared towards vocational, professional, personal and interpersonal skills and rely on a specified time frame.\n\nOn the other hand, CBE is a framework that favours the mastery of concrete skills or competencies over higher-order learning. CBE breaks down larger skill sets into several competencies, thereby providing sequential levels of mastery.\n\nEssentially, the competency-based approach is more flexible, while the Outcome-based method relies heavily on the accumulation of course credits and completion.\n\n\nExplore new ways of teaching supported by Acer solutions\nWant to keep your school technology up-to-date with the latest EdTech trends?\nContact our Team!

So why wait? \n\nAuthor and digital marketer Robert Stark has shared with Acer 10 Essential Computer Maintenance Tips for PCs. Let??s take a look.\n\n\n1 ?V Clean your keyboard regularly \n\nHow to clean your dirty and dusty keyboard? Did you know that a PC keys can be 20,000 times dirtier than a toilet seat? The best way to clean a keyboard is using a damp, lint-free cloth. A quick weekly wipe is enough to restore cleanliness and peace of mind! \n\nHard to press or sticky keys are likely clogged with dust, dirt or debris. In this case, compressed air is the solution. How to proceed?\n\n1. Turn your laptop off and unplug USB and power plugs. \n2. Turn the laptop upside down and gently tap its underside to dislodge any debris.\n3. Return the laptop to its original position and spray compressed air between keys from a distance of about 1-inch. \n4. Spray in short bursts moving from one side of the keyboard to the other and back again, if necessary.\n\n\n2 ?V Keep cables organised\n\nEver noticed how cables seem to have a talent for tangling and mixing up? We??ve all been there. Thankfully, there are various solutions.\n\nOrganize cords by type, grouping them with zip ties. If they are particularly numerous, try labelling cords so you know what each is for at a glance. You might even decide that a PC cable management system, such as a cable box, is suitable for you!\n\n\n3 ?V Wipe down monitor \n\nHow many times do you and your students point at your laptop screen during class? You??re probably asking yourself how to wipe a computer monitor to remove fingertips. The answer is a lint-free microfiber cloth slightly dampened with distilled water. \n\nNever use bleach or hash chemicals of any kind. Avoid using a circular motion when you clean. Long, gentle side-to-side or top-to-bottom strokes are best. And to avoid screen damage, never apply pressure!\n\n\n4 ?V Tips to maximise battery life \n\nLooking to optimize your battery??s lifespan? Avoid the common mistake of keeping it constantly under charge! Lithium-ion batteries last longer operating at a charge of 20-80% ?V so always unplug the charger when you reach 100%.\n\nAlso note that when a device is in storage, the battery drains?K and can be damaged if it sits unused for long periods. So if you don??t plan to use your device for over a month, it??s best to unplug it ?V even though the best practice would be to charge the battery from time to time during lengthy storage periods.\n\nFinally, be sure to remove the battery if the laptop is constantly plugged in.\n\nNote: New laptops should be charged for over 24 hours before the first use!\n\n\n5 ?V Run antivirus and malware scans regularly \n\nMalware, viruses, and cyber threats can seriously damage your devices ?V particularly in schools. Running regular scans with good antivirus products will save you from ransomware, data loss, performance issues and headaches!\n\nRead more: Cyber Security at school: best practices in the digital era \n\nWe recommend well-reviewed antivirus software such as the Norton Security Ultra or Microsoft Defender Antivirus ?V a valuable built-in option for Windows OS.\n\n\n6 ?V Purge your system of junk files & programs \n\nFinding your PC unusually sluggish? Then it??s time to get rid of junk files and unused programs to free up hard drive space and improve performance!\n\nThe first step would be manually uninstalling unused programs from your Control Panel then emptying the recycle bin. Secondly, remove browser cookies and empty your cache. Thirdly, you can run disk cleanup software such as CCLeaner and delete temporary files with Windows Disk Cleanup.\n\n\n7 ?V Defragment the hard drive \n\nDisk cleanup isn??t always enough. Next on your computer maintenance checklist is defragmentation to restore speed.\n\nAdding and removing files can cause your hard drive to become fragmented, thereby spreading out files. In this event, the hard drive must work harder to access the files, resulting in a computer slowdown. The advantages of disk defragmentation are speeding up access again by rearranging and compacting files.\n\nSSD drives don??t require defragmenting so much as older hard disks. However, the Windows Defrag Tool has you covered with both drive types! Follow these simple steps to defragment your hard disk:\n\n1. Type ??defrag?? into the Windows taskbar search and choose Defragment and Optimize Drives. \n2. Select the drive to defragment and click Optimize. \n3. Set a regular defrag schedule ?V daily, weekly, or monthly ?V via Select Change settings.\n\nWe recommend defragging your hard drive at least once a month.\n\n\n\n8 ?V Keep your PC cool \n\nWhen a PC??s heat-dissipating cooling system malfunctions, the device can overheat, leading to crashes, slowdowns and other problems. The first defence against PC overheating is the fan. Make sure it??s working correctly, and remove dust using compressed air. These devices require adequate ventilation. The objective is to keep your CPU cool. Heavy programs such as games can use much CPU power, often overheating.\n\nPay attention to where you use your laptop! The portability of our devices means they can follow us onto the sofa or even into bed, but such surfaces can block vents. Keep in mind that flat, hard surfaces are your best bet. Try to keep at least two inches of free space on both sides of your device, avoid direct sunlight and always store in a cool, dry place.\n\n\n9 ?V Update Windows OS and programs \n\nThe benefits of updating your operating system include improved computer security and performance. \n\nThe safest way to get driver updates in Windows OS is through the handy Windows Update. We also suggest installing the latest Acer driver software and firmware.\n\n\n10 ?V Backup your data \n\nHere??s the final step of your computer cleaning routine. One of the most common best practices for files such as assignments, student information, databases and legal papers is backing up data. \n\nCloud storage services such as Google Drive or OneDrive keep data safely stored off your computer. Those who prefer hardware can opt for a USB drive or external hard disk.\n\nWe hope you use this helpful information to improve the lifespan of your devices ?V a laptop or a desktop ?V and we encourage you to share these tips and best practices with your colleagues and students!\n\nSource: 10 Essential Computer Maintenance Tips for Your PC (2022) | Acer Corner \n\n\nFind the best devices for your school with Acer\nWould you like to upgrade your school tech to be up-to-date with the latest EdTech trends?\nContact our Team and find the best solution for your needs: acerforeducation.emea@acer.com '),

It basically features the game??s original mechanics while offering specific features designed for learning environments.\n\nLike standard Minecraft, the Education Edition allows players to collect, build, craft, and battle non-playable evil characters called mobs.  But this game is heavily geared toward STEM classes with purpose-built features.\n\nTeachers new to Minecraft??s Education Edition can rely on the support of the hands-on aid provided by the game. And this version features unique ??equip educators?? options, with exclusive tools for subjects like coding, math and chemistry.\n\nTaking, for example, the latter, the ??Education Edition??, gives players a chance to collect and combine chemical elements to create compounds such as salt, glue and other standard in-game items.\n\nAs for coding, the game features a mob called ??the agent??. Via a visual interface, students learn the basics of coding and put them to use to instruct the agent or other non-playable characters featured in the game!\n\nFirst and foremost, ??Minecraft: Education Edition?? fosters classroom collaboration.

Plus, it fosters engagement, increases motivation and interest in certain subjects and offers immediate feedback to pupils.\n\nCurious to learn more? Read on!\n\n\nThe neuroscience behind gamification in education\n\nWhat makes gamification so effective? The answer is in neuroscience. Several experts have studied gaming systems applied to different fields ?V from learning to business training. \n\nAs a result, gamification in education statistics proven that brain-wise, gamification increases a feeling of motivation and enjoyment through dopamine release and hippocampus stimulation.\n\nAs for the benefits of gamification in the classroom, there are plenty. Firstly, playing keeps the brain healthy by training memory and attention and preventing cognitive decline. Secondly, it relies on emotions, which makes learning retention more effective. Finally, gamification??s storytelling-dynamic helps students process information without boring them with lists of notions. \n\n\nLearn how to gamify your classroom\n\nNow that you know a little more about how gamification works, let??s put it into practice. Here are some basic strategies to help you out. \n\n1. Set up a point system and start assigning points for completing tasks\n\nIf integrated with class activities, point systems allow students to visualise their progress and encourage their motivation!\n\n2. Promote healthy competition with leaderboards\n\nCreating competition among peers is a great way to improve performance. What??s more, you can create more than one leaderboard based on different achievements. \n\nBy doing so, you will promote various types of skills and make things more inclusive for all students.\n\n3. Assign badges & awards\n\nReward-based systems are excellent to show your class that you value effort and hard work. For instance, you can create a criterion based on points and assign badges. Or even term-end awards.\n\n4. Create a mission with an objective\n\nUnleash your creativity! Use apps like Google Slides and create a quest where students need to unlock objectives to move forward. For example, you can create a cross-curricular mission that includes Maths, reading and science, and put a badge on the line!\n\n5. Go full boss mode\n\nAs classic video games taught us, every level ends with a boss battle. So, are you ready to take up the mantle at the end of point 4??s quest? Prepare a list of more challenging questions and ask your students to answer with a time limit. You can even split your pupils into teams and let them cooperate to win.\n\n\nWhat??s your take on gamification?\nIf you have any previous experience with gamified learning, let us know on our social media and Teachers Community. \n\nFinally, don??t forget that you don??t need to necessarily invest in third-party software to help you out with your gamification project.

The pandemic??s major shift consolidated the strong bond between innovation, learning, and teaching in the past two years. \n\nIn fact, EdTech allowed schools and campuses to get through one of the world??s biggest challenges. At the same time, it also pushed itself towards new heights of development, which are expected to expand in 2022.\n\nSo, a few weeks into the new year, let??s take a closer look at the most exciting prospects for technology in education in the upcoming twelve months, according to Forbes.\n\n\nPersonalised learning\n\nAddressing pupils?? specific needs, interests, backgrounds, and aspirations is the core of personalised learning in schools. Thankfully, the pandemic, and subsequent growth of EdTech, brought schools one step closer to full accomplishing this scope.\n\nAt the same time, more digital tools in the hands of teachers allowed them to gain a better understanding of students?? data, with deeper insights and a more detailed evaluation of their progress.\n\n\nClosing the gap\n\nAccess to digital devices, parental support with home learning and broadband speeds have been the significant challenges students overcame in the past two years, especially for less fortunate families.\n\nAs countries like the U.S. set aside capital, more and more EdTech programs are expected to be implemented by schools to tackle tailored needs and narrow existing gaps.\n\n\nFocusing on the teacher-student relationship\n\nThe early stages of the pandemic urged to lever, effective remote learning practices in the fastest possible way.\n\nNow that students, teachers, and schools are more familiar and confident with virtual learning tools, experts foresee a bigger focus on human interaction this year. Subsequently, the teacher-student relationship will come to the fore thanks to human-centred technology solutions.\n\n\nBlended and hybrid learning are not going away\n\nThese approaches might have risen due to the Covid-19 emergency, but they are definitely not going away. Even with a partial or full-scale return to in-presence classes, teachers will still leverage blended learning and hybrid learning possibilities in 2022. \n\nIn fact, the tools introduced in the past two years have become a mainstay in today??s education system and will further allow schools to capitalise on the investments made in 2020 to answer remote learning needs. \n\nFurthermore, many students thrive in hybrid and blended scenarios, more than they do in traditional classes, and several parents continue to prefer these options. \n\n\nGamification\n\nThe use of digital game-like dynamics will become even more prominent in 2022. In truth, experts agree that gamification will also be mastered by students who will create content for one another. \n\nClearly, gamification also mixes healthy competitiveness and effectiveness for teachers who wish to deliver educational tasks more engagingly. Moreover, these practices are so impactful on younger pupils?? because they spent the last two years learning online, but also and socialising remotely.\n\n\nEdTech in 2022: our perspective\n\nAlongside what Forbes reported, at Acer, we have monitored three more EdTech trends we expect to thrive in 2022.\n\n\nSustainability\n\nThis is not an actual trend but a priority. Our planet is calling for a commitment to a comprehensive, greener approach, and schools are answering. \n\nAn eco-friendly choice in EdTech resources, together with best practices, can really improve your institute??s footprint. \n\nAs a matter of fact, picking devices that are performing while also environmentally friendly, with optimised energy consumption and upgradable built-to-last designs, can make a difference in the long haul.\n\nAt Acer, we provide eco-friendly schools with more sustainable laptops and green PCs.

Esports and education is simply a match made in heaven.\n\nWhat??s more, for students interested in entering the professional Esports world, there are not only several exciting career opportunities as players but also as team managers, content creators, trainers and more.\n\nAre you new to this discipline, and would you like to discover more?

Even though reading, writing and speaking can be heavily affected by this condition, it doesn??t prevent students from learning. They simply learn at their own pace and deserve equal opportunities to grow in the classroom. \n\nThis disorder affects pupils of any economic and ethnic environment. Today, educators are growing more and more aware of teaching methods to provide students with special needs with everything they require to succeed in their learning. \n\nNevertheless, alongside appropriate and well-known best practices, the right EdTech companion can be a game-changer in assisting students with dyslexia to get the best out of their learning process. \n\n\nDefining dyslexia and how it affects learning\n\nDyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty interpreting or reading letters, words or symbols. Individuals who have dyslexia experience issues identifying speech sounds and decoding them. To rephrase it, they struggle with learning how letters and words relate to sounds.\n\nStatistically speaking, it is much more widespread than you might think. According to dyslexia.com, roughly 780 million people worldwide could be suffering from this disorder, and it??s a common condition among children. \n\nFor dyslexic students, reading can require exhausting levels of concentration and cause frustration and reluctance. Even the most common classroom task, such as reading aloud, can mine students?? confidence in such a vital part of the age of learning. \n\nOn top of that, this type of hereditary disorder impacts comprehension and ultimately affects the lexicon and background knowledge. \n\n\nSupporting students with dyslexia in school with Texthelp??s Read&Write\n\nAt Acer for Education, we team up with the best EdTech partners to unlock the potential of all students. Our associates at Texthelp provide solutions to support people in reading, writing and communicating across all stages of their lives. \n\nWhile discussing dyslexia in school, their Read&Write software is a literacy support toolbar that you shouldn??t be without in your classroom.\n\nFor starters, students with dyslexia usually struggle with comprehending what they read. Thanks to Read&Write??s text-to-speech technology, your pupils will by having texts read aloud. That means a better understanding of tasks, lectures, and written information in general.\n\nMoreover, the additional dictionary support is another unmissable key feature. As we mentioned above, one of the consequences of students with dyslexia??s reading difficulties is expanding their vocabulary. Thanks to the dictionary feature, pupils will get the chance to have a description and sample sentence for each word in a text. It??s a win-win situation because they can enjoy more visualisation while enhancing their writing and reading skills.\n\nTexthelp??s Read&Write has some more aces up its sleeves. To encourage dyslexic pupils to exercise their writing skills, the toolbar also allows voice recording and transforming it into written text.\n\nFinally, to reduce the impact of attention difficulties, thanks to Read&Write, learners with dyslexia can also highlight what they want to focus on while masking the surrounding areas.

To answer the shut down of institutes in the first place and secondly to get ready to welcome back students to their learning environments, 1:1 programs quickly became a hot topic. But what does it take to start a successful one-to-one program in a higher education institution?\n\n\nOne device for every student\n\nThe term ??one-to-one?? refers to learning programs that provide each student from a school, district, college or campus with their own laptop. In the current global scenario, where technology drives innovation in all sectors, a suitable device becomes a masterful ally in the hands of each learner, a critical factor in the pursuit of their dreams.\n\nWhether your institute is starting from ground zero or refreshing its fleet, a 1:1 program represents a significant investment. For this very reason, decision-makers need to ask themselves the right questions before moving forward.\n\nFirst of all, each degree course features very specific subjects and characteristics. Therefore, choosing a device for every student following a single learning path needs to be highly accurate. For example, students pursuing a degree in design have different needs from those studying liberal arts. The same goes for engineers and medical professionals in the making, to name a few examples. \n\nAfter selecting the right laptop according to the faculty type, your university or college network might need an upgrade. That may be your case, especially if you foresee a considerable increase in the number of devices connected to your bandwidth compared to last year. Several students might be attending remote classes from their dorms, labs or shared spaces; hence executives might consider adding wireless access points or powering up their networks before moving on. \n\n\nPreparing IT departments for one-to-one in higher education\n\nAlongside setting up the network and choosing the most suitable device for your students, you also need to take into account the IT side of things. \n\nA fleet of university/college devices may include a vast number of laptops and even desktops from laboratories and libraries. They will all need to be deployed and enrolled into the institute network while also easily manageable and secure enough to protect students?? data from hackers. \n\nIn order to tackle this effectively, the IT department devices will have to be selected wisely. And the same goes for the fleet??s deployment system. Thanks to Windows Autopilot or Chrome OS zero-touch enrollment, Acer devices can be automatically deployed and enrolled to free the IT department from this time-consuming task.\n\nLast but not least, long-term maintenance and management are undoubtedly essential. In this sense, you will need to roll out strategic plans to replace potentially damaged devices and promptly solve their problems or replace them to prevent learning loss.\n\nAcer laptops for higher education include a vast portfolio of reliable and performing devices suitable for multiple learning needs and areas.

The global pandemic brought along unpredictable changes, forcing schools to adapt to distance learning for most of 2020 and 2021. \n\nThis shift didn??t come without challenges, especially regarding K-12 schools, which, traditionally speaking, were less familiar with virtual learning at a large scale until the COVID-19 outbreak. Up-and-coming digital learning models cemented their importance and will keep on growing in the years to come.\n\n\nDifferences with Blended Learning and perspectives\n\nWhile many still think that hybrid learning and blended learning are synonyms, there is a key difference between the two definitions. They mainly differ in the relationship between online and in-person learning.\n\nBlended learning is focused on balancing distance learning with face-to-face interaction. In this type of environment, resources such as videos, podcasts, online lectures, articles and LMS play a complementary role. In a nutshell, EdTech is meant to enhance the in-class learning experience.\n\nBy contrast, the online factor is much more prominent in hybrid scenarios. Hybrid learning leans heavily on the remote side and incorporates multiple teaching techniques to create a flexible environment. Asynchronous online material makes an integral part of the main lesson plan, and resources available on the internet are a valuable alternative to in-person materials. What??s more, hybrid learning??s so-called Hy-Flex iteration foresees the possibility of simultaneous one-to-one and online learning, with some pupils attending in person and others following classes from home, while it??s the same teacher to deliver the lesson.\n\nStudies have shown that even though traditional learning is still the preferred option for a number of teachers, several schools and parents strongly support hybrid learning, especially because of its flexibility. Let??s take a closer look at why hybrid learning has not been simply a temporary solution, but it will still be relevant in the 2021/2022 school year.\n\n\nHybrid Learning is here to stay: here??s why\n\nThe first and foremost reason is related to the current global scenario. While each country is running its vaccination campaign at its own pace, it??s still unclear how many younger students will be vaccinated before the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. This brings along a degree of uncertainty for families who want to keep their children safe. At the same time, teachers who are more apprehensive because of underlying health issues can reduce contact with students.\n\nSecondly, thanks to hybrid learning, pupils can learn at their own pace without the pressure of in-person interaction. At the same time, parents can get a greater insight into their sons or daughters?? learning, and teachers can deliver more personalised outcomes, especially for students with specific learning needs. \n\nMoreover, in hybrid scenarios, learners have an active responsibility to accomplish their tasks. In the long run, this will have a positive impact on the students?? style of learning, helping them develop a self-directed independent approach to education that will come particularly handy in higher studies. Plus, the hybrid model relies mostly on online content, which has proved to be highly effective in terms of engagement and retention. \n\nFinally, we can??t underestimate the fact that families who experience financial or logistical difficulties can benefit from having their children learning from home, even if it??s only for a few days per week. \n\n\nWhat schools can do to enhance hybrid learning models\n\nRegardless of the global pandemic, hybrid learning can become an engine for a great change in the world of education. Educators need to learn how to make the best of this approach and welcome it as a positive upgrade that can be beneficial for everyone. Undoubtedly, hybrid learning can also be applied partially, as schools can decide to incorporate only selected hybrid elements into their programs. \n\nOf course, the implementation of this model doesn??t come without challenges related to funds, training and inventiveness. With many schools massively shifting from full online learning to a hybrid format, teachers and principals need to roll out a plan on how to manage their classes. Creating an alternate schedule could be a good way to start, for example.\n\n\n\nTraining resources\nTeachers also need to be provided with targeted training on how to facilitate in-class and virtual learning. Experienced colleagues and senior educators can play a huge role in this respect, helping fellow less-experienced teachers to upskill.\n\nCertainly, It??s key for IT managers and school administrators to make sure teachers are equipped with the proper tools, devices and hardware to hold classes with the same degree of effectiveness, for both online and in-person lessons. Speaking of IT management, highly qualified staff is essential to support teachers and students with any possible tech challenge that may occur.\n\nIn conclusion, it??s also important to keep in mind that hybrid learning models take time to perfect. It could take up to a semester, or even a full academic year to reach an equilibrium. That is why it??s crucial to maintain a positive attitude among the school staff, students and their families.\n\nAre you a teacher looking for the best device for teaching on a hybrid learning schedule?

Empathy is a key element of Emotional Intelligence. Emotionally Intelligent people are able to manage and control their own emotions. Besides that, empathetic people pay attention not only to what they are feeling but also they can perceive someone??s thoughts and feelings.\n\nNowadays, empathy is one of the most important soft skills in the workplace and everyday life. An empathetic leadership style can have a positive impact on productivity, performance, and collaboration. \n\n\nThe importance of Empathy in the Classroom\n\nEmpathy is crucial for developing healthy relationships, and there??s tons of research on the importance of empathy in the classroom. First of all, teachers need to be empathetic, which means being able to listen to and be present for students. The more a teacher can empathize with students, the more the teacher will make students feel good about themselves, and safe to make mistakes. On the other hand, it??s necessary to teach empathy to students, from an early age. \n\nIt means that empathy is a skill that can be developed and learned. Considering the growing use of tech in the classroom, what??s the role that technology plays in teaching empathy? \n\n\nHow technology can help kids become empathetic digital citizens\n\nVR immersion training is an effective teaching method to develop empathy. One of VR??s biggest strengths is its ability to tap into students?? emotions. Some studies have found that embodying avatars of other races can reduce racial bias. Another study developed by Stanford University and called ??Becoming Homeless??, demonstrated that people who saw in virtual reality what it would be like to lose their jobs and homes developed longer-lasting compassion toward the homeless, compared to those who explored other media versions of the VR scenario, like text. So, what??s the benefit of virtual reality in education? \n\nFirstly, VR allows them to learn new skills, including empathy, by creating the perceptual illusion of ??embodiment??: introverted children can control their feelings and reactions and make practice in a ??simulated reality??. This exercise will help them to develop their self-awareness and self-confidence, as well as their empathy. \n\nWhat if VR is not available? In the last year, global education changed dramatically, with the rise of e-learning. In this scenario, it??s crucial to help students to become more responsible as digital citizens by building empathy in digital spaces through distance and remote learning tools. \n\nTeachers are responsible to maintain the sense of connection and fun that normally students experience in the physical classroom. They also should be holding virtual office hours and offer new ways to engage with the classroom, without missing the social aspect of the learning experience. \n\nMoreover, all the variety of digital tools and apps allow students to meet people and guest speakers from all over the world. This will help them to see new perspectives and to broaden their perspective. In fact, empathy and kindness come naturally with meeting people in different places. \n\nLast but not least, online group work allows developing empathetic interaction among smaller groups of students. Teachers can encourage to work on cooperative tasks and this promotes the rise of collaboration, empathy and healthy relationships. \n\nBring innovation to your school.

After going through several approaches to keep your class engaged, from gamification to flipped learning, let??s take a look at the best practices and tips to get the most out of breakout rooms in remote learning. \n\n\nBreakout rooms in remote learning: everything you need to know \n\nBreakout rooms represent a resourceful feature that is often overlooked. Did you know you can break your virtual classroom meeting into smaller separate meetings?\n\nThis is not only a great way to fight off turned-off screens and muted microphones. Breakout rooms will help you foster peer-to-peer collaboration and productivity. Most importantly, give your students an active role in their learning. When you think about it, breakout rooms enable you to create smaller groups just like you would do in your physical classroom for whatever purpose: from discussions to station teaching, from group projects to debates. Breakout rooms are also great to deliver personalised learning outcomes, having multiple teachers managing different groups in different ways according to distinct needs.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that breakout rooms serve as a space that can give your students voice and freedom to choose, even in a virtual scenario, which might look a little detached at first. Thus, a good rule number one would be turning the camera on and unmuting the microphones.\n\nBreakout rooms are surely a great choice for remote learning activities. What??s best, they can also be implemented in hybrid classrooms to get all the students equally involved.\n\n\nHow to make breakout rooms work for group activities\n\nConsider creating several small groups with a definite number of students per each, and let your class pick which one to join. You can even assign them manually, and shuffle them when the time is right. Even though it may not be easy having all the small groups working well together, you can consider picking ice-breaking team building activities ahead of each group meeting: students will get comfortable with each other and this will not only help them work better together, it will also nurture their social and communication skills. \n\nOn the practical side of things, it is very important to pick specific individual tasks for every breakout room and set a reasonable time limit for each activity. This will help you make sure peers spend their time working together to reach a goal, while also having to be synthetic and effective. On the other hand, you would want your students to understand they shouldn??t simply focus on getting the activity done. Breakout rooms should encourage them to listen and speak while being an active part of meaningful discussions.\n\nFinally, take into account implementing team roles for the learners of every group to promote a sense of ownership of their learning activity. You could begin by assigning the team leader role, who will keep the group on track and engage his/her peers. Secondly, you may consider the timekeeper, note-taker, presenter, and more. By doing so, at first, you will be able to play along with students?? personalities or even help them out of the comfort zone by assigning creative roles.\n\nGet started with breakout rooms on the online learning solution that fits your needs.

To put it simply, to exchange and transfer data without requiring direct intervention. IoT has become an integral part of the innovation brought to schools by EdTech in recent years. Even though it is not as widespread as of now, it will soon find its way into more and more institutions in the upcoming years.\n\n\nWhy choose IoT in education?\n\nWhile it is already providing notable transformations for companies, government agencies, and more, the Internet of Things is joining other EdTech resources embraced by educational institutions to elevate teaching, learning, and classroom management to new heights. IoT gadgets can help teachers focus on the achievement of better learning outcomes for their pupils. In other words, implementing IoT technology will equip educators with new professional tools to improve their classwork and even improve their connection with students.\n\n\nImproving teaching and learning with IoT technology\n\nTeachers?? agendas are often packed. Their time is divided into preparing lessons, correcting assignments, managing the classroom, and the list goes on. The Internet of Things can increase the teaching time by automating time-consuming routine tasks, such as attendance monitoring. This means more energy to focus on the students?? learning and retention of information.\n\nSecondly, we cannot ignore the importance of the IoT when it comes to data collecting. By processing bytes and bytes of data in real-time, the Internet of Things offers the chance to monitor and track students?? performances, thus allowing to improve teaching methods and provide specific help for learners in need. \n\nProfessors and educators can also take advantage of the IoT to implement professional training tools and share resources with other teachers worldwide to trade best practices and create uniform teaching standards. Speaking of global interconnectedness, in the same way, students will be able to share learning materials between peers, as well as access virtual libraries by simply scanning a QR code.\n\nIn the upcoming school years, IoT-powered classrooms will be made possible, and gadgets like VR headsets and smartboards will make the learning and teaching experience more engaging and enjoyable. Applications of the Internet of Things can also enhance methodologies like flipped learning, and allow students with special needs to bridge their gap without the involvement of special curricula.  \n\n\nMore potential IoT applications\n\nOn the school management level, the Internet of Things can automate several processes and reduce storage costs thanks to cloud-based technology. Moreover, smart meters powered by IoT technology can screen energy consumption and manage usage of electricity. Smart lights, for example, will automatically switch lights off in empty classrooms, or calibrate on natural light.\n\nIoT will also perform as a useful resource to address safety matters. From smart cameras with facial recognition, to smoke and vape detectors. These implementations will upgrade security inside schools and institutions, albeit with some privacy concerns. \n\nBring innovation to your school.

Technology played a major role in this respect: in fact, with the massive shift to remote and hybrid schedules, EdTech helped completely reshape learning and teaching. The following list features 10 EdTech trending topics in higher education to keep an eye on right now and in the future post-pandemic world.\n\n1 ?V Promoting inclusivity and accessibility\n\nThis entry is a bit of a stretch. Inclusivity and accessibility go beyond the concept of trend. They are pillars of the world of today??s education and their importance is growing more and more every day. Schools will need to keep on providing adaptive solutions tailored to meet the learning needs of different students, be them learners with learning deficiencies, disabilities, speakers of minority languages, or disadvantaged in general, in order to make sure nobody is left behind. \n\n\n2 ?V Blockchain \n\nBased on growing lists of records (blocks) linked using cryptography, this technology is becoming increasingly central in several organisations and educational institutions worldwide. Blockchain allows exchanging information and data with the protection of highly secure protocols. It could be implemented to safely issue diplomas, transfer student information between universities, and share academic data with companies for recruitment, just to name a few. \n\n\n3 ?V The consolidation of the HyFlex model\n\nThe best of both worlds: the hybrid flexible pedagogical approach combines online learning with face-to-face lessons. This model has been already widely adopted in schools to create a dynamic learning agenda: with the support of the proper technology infrastructure and tools, each class and learning activity can be delivered synchronously online and asynchronously online or in-person.\n\n\n4 ?V Big data\n\nOne of the issues raised during distance learning concerned the difficulty for teachers to offer the same supervision they usually offered during school hours in-person. Through the use of specific apps to collect data from their students, teachers are enabled to monitor their classes effectively, evaluate their performances, understand what can be improved, and ultimately bring better outcomes and adjust school curricula.\n\n\n5 ?V Adapting tools for the future\n\nOnline education has offered the perfect proving ground for the adoption of platforms that could bring better and more effective achievements.

He chose to do so through imagery made of pictures, images, and videos, understanding that he didn??t need to find his inspiration from anywhere but the world we live in. That??s why he is continuously trying to make his students develop a critical and detail-oriented view of reality:\n ??Life is art and art is life [?K] To me, teaching is equal to creating. It??s all about being curious and being inspired by the world around us and its details.??\nConceptD became the best companion for Raul because it allowed him to reproduce the same accuracy his eyes see in his creative digital projects. Thanks to its 4K UHD PANTONE? Validated display, faithful color reproduction, and the color accuracy of Delta E <2, ConceptD 7 Ezel gave Raul the tools he needed to capture his inspiration anywhere he is. What??s more, he takes full advantage of the device??s six different display modes, to easily work and present in front of his pupils, and quickly switch to his personal professional projects when he leaves the classroom.\nFurthermore, with a busy agenda like Raul??s, fast real-time previews while editing, smooth exports, and easy rendering of heavy video files are simply essential. By combining ConcepD??s powerful hardware and the MAGIX Suite software bundle, multitasking while editing has never been easier, no matter how packed his routine is.\nTo Raul, teaching a creative subject is more than educating. While on the one hand, he wants his students to learn the fundamentals of becoming a creative professional, on the other, he constantly longs for his lessons to be a real moment of sharing:\n??Creativity sets me free: it opens the door to the world inside my head. It??s like a therapy. I want my students to feel the same way, to be able to turn their own world into reality and express themselves with no limits.??\nWindows 10 Pro allowed Raul to turn his lessons into real experiences, empowering his productivity and skills as a teacher, while also allowing him to work from remote safely thanks to the limitless protection provided by Windows Security.\nLearn more about Raul and his story: watch the full interview.\n\nLearn more about the ConceptD series: contact us at acerforeducation.emea@acer.com.

Quadro RTX? 5000 MaxQ1 graphics card, with up to 32GB of DDR4 memory, and up to 2TB PCIe NVMe SSDs in Raid 0, Antony gets faster real-time previews while editing, or smoothly export and render up to 6K video files and 3D designs.\nTo hold lectures in the most experiential and complete way, the MAGIX Suite completed his toolkit: a total package including all the video and audio editing softwares necessary to satisfy any creative need, at home, in class, or anywhere.\nApproaching a young generation of students has never been a real issue for Antony. Quite the opposite, actually. The transition from his creative work to education represented a professional evolution that keeps stimulating him every day, even though his guard has to be continuously up:\n??This generation is made of very smart and sharp kids. The best thing about teaching a creative subject is definitely the privilege of dealing with a younger generation of designers and creative spirits.??\nTo keep up with these young creators, Antony found in Windows 10 Pro the perfect partner to enhance its productivity and never miss a beat.

Maha spent her life between Syria, Lebanon, Netherlands and Italy, cultivating her creativity while growing up.\nShe got two degrees, one in Art History and Fine Arts with a minor in Anthropology, and the second in Communication and Graphic Design, and while launching her career as Art Director, both with a creative agency and as a freelancer in the fashion industry, she also became an educator and tutor: she addresses students between the age of 17 and 19 towards their future creative careers.\nAs a professional and creative teacher, Maha draws inspiration from all of her past and present experience to boost her projects to the maximum of their potential, and, above all, to help her students to get a deeper understanding of what a creative process actually implies. To her, teaching is a two-sided creative process that involves both giving and learning something:\n??I love teaching creative subjects for three reasons: you never stop learning, you keep on exercising your creativity and you always get the chance to share something with your students.??\nMaha acknowledges the importance of her role in shaping students?? know-how and fostering their imagination, this is why she chose ConceptD and the Adobe Suite as her teaching partners:\n??As a creative person I need to find a way to translate  what I have in mind into reality, and I can easily do that by using ConceptD with Adobe in both my work life and teaching life. Because sometimes words are not enough: you need to transmit your idea through a little station,  an image, anything?K and with ConceptD & Adobe I can easily bring my ideas to life.??\nConceptD 3 allows Maha to observe any detail around her and make it count in the best possible way, thanks to the RGB 100% color gamut, the color accuracy of its Delta E <2, and its PANTONE? Validated display. The creative precision that ConceptD 3 gives to Maha is fundamental for both her job and her students.\nAdditionally, with Adobe Creative Cloud she can balance her teaching with flexibility, always supported by a reliable device that allows her to express her ideas through specific imageries, providing a strong visual support that takes learning to a whole new level.\nAt the moment, Maha holds most of her classes online: this implies sharing several files, documents, presentations and so on, but her work has never been safer, because she can rely on the total protection provided by Windows 10 Pro??s Windows Security, the ultimate and always-updated warranty against online threats.\nLearn more about Maha, Conceptd3 and her creative teaching approach:\n\nWould you like to learn more about the ConceptD series: contact us at acerforeducation.emea@acer.com and let us take you into our world!'),

At the time I started thinking about and designing my own video games, from the atmosphere to the gameplay, to the graphics and music, everything.??\nWhile he was considering a career as a videogame developer, his creative view was shaken up by the world-famous director David Lynch. Thanks to his productions, Ruben realised that the same abstract elements he would have liked to put into his videogames fitted perfectly in the cinematic context. This revelation led him to the world of film.\nGrowing up, he finally took Directing studies, pursuing his filmmaking dream and following a very simple and spontaneous approach to creativity:\n??I think it??s very important, in order to have any kind of creative idea, to remain open and receptive without having any kind of anxiety and just simply going about your daily life. I don??t think about sitting down and saying <Now I??m gonna be creative.>??\nWith tight schedules and busy days spent between shooting and editing, Ruben found in ConceptD 7 the ultimate creative partner to carry out multiple tasks even when time seems to be not enough. With the MAGIX Bundle he can take care of several different aspects of a movie production, from sound editing to colour correction, from post-production to video editing, in and out of the set, while Windows 10 Pro powers up his workflow providing high performances and allowing multitasking with no sign of hiccups or slowdowns. Not to mention protection: with Windows Security, his ConceptD 7 is always updated against the latest virus threats, keeping his ideas safe and sound.\nFollowing the story of the Fashion Designer Nastaran, and after the deep dive into the world of Product Design and Branding with Carlotta and Jacob, it??s now Ruben??s turn to show you a brand new personal take on creativity:\n\nDiscover how we are fostering a brand new wave of creators with ConceptD.\nWould you like to learn more about the ConceptD series?

Online does not equal alone\n\nUnless educators and students actively seek out social interaction, online learning tends to be stripped down to its purely academic aspects and deprived of the interpersonal ones, but this can be remedied.\nVideo conferencing may not be a complete substitute for seeing your friends in person, but it is the next best thing when meeting face to face is deemed unsafe: reserve some time for conferences meant to connect with classmates rather than just online meetings intended as a replacement for lectures. Tools such as Google Meet and Microsoft Teams have been used to great effect during the height of the lockdown to stay in touch with friends and family and class groups are no different. In fact, online communication expands the possibility to create friendships far beyond your own school or neighbourhood.\nOnline assignments do not have to be a lonely pursuit, either: learning to manage a group project online is not only a great lesson in teamwork and conflict resolution, but also familiarizes students with collaboration tools such as Google Docs that they might one day find themselves using on the job.\n\n\n2.      Learning can be fun\n\nGame-based learning (GBL) is the use of educational games to teach specific skills and facts through games with a full-fledged storyline and reward system that makes the learning process more engaging and increases gratification.\nSharing the experience of learning through games is a form of socialisation: whether they are comparing results and competing or sharing tips and strategies, students are, in fact, forming relationships through educational games, be they adversarial or collaborative.\nEven if the storyline of the game is very simple, it provides something to talk about and a shared language (any terminology that is specific to the game, for instance) that brings the class closer together and makes students feel like a team.\n\n\n3.      Get your game on\n\nNot all games with an educational value were originally meant to be educational. Minecraft is perhaps the greatest example of this: the degree of freedom that the game affords makes it adaptable to any number of school activities.\nMinecraft, however, is not the only title that can hone your students?? interpersonal skills while having fun. Playing video games is often seen as something solitary, but there are plenty of games available that rely heavily on strategizing in real time with online teammates: your friends may not be in the room with you, but you are still interacting with them and establishing hierarchies and game plans via typing or voice chat.\nProvided that your students are in possession of powerful enough machines that allow them to play competitively, staying home might just be the push you need to create a school esports programme for your less traditionally athletic students to enjoy the experience of being a part of a team: depending on the games they play, entering the esports arena can be a lesson in teamwork, strategic thinking, decision-making, even finance and management, and can improve their cognitive abilities, from hand-eye coordination to focus and multitasking, in measurable ways that will reflect positively on their academics. The educational value of video games may be an unintended side effect, but it is still very much real.');

This kind of software can also be crucial in strengthening communication between schools and families and even in supporting device management and configuration, a vital aspect in realities where teachers are also acting as IT administrators.\nThe main objective of classroom management tools, however, is to leave teachers free to focus on what really matters: learning.\nThat is why we are also partnering with ISVs offering tools aimed at transforming the learning experience itself, from educational games and other interactive solutions improving students?? engagement such as Quizlet, to learning platforms that can be a one-stop shop for all their educational needs, to software offering additional support while they practice new skills and ideas. With Texthelp??s assistive technology, for instance, literacy (digital or otherwise) has never been so easy.\n\n\nFull STEAM ahead!\n\nSTEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics, and it represents a powerful combination of topics and techniques to enhance the students?? critical thinking skills by showing that the same reasoning and problem-solving tools in one??s mental toolbox can be applied to the sciences and the humanities both.\nWe believe in forging alliances with companies offering STEAM solutions that allow teachers to deploy a method based on learning by doing, where the goal of the lesson is not just to learn about one topic at a time, but to apply principles from multiple areas to a real-world problem to be solved as a team?Xand if one solution fails, you can just adapt and try the next one! From learning coding from an early age with Micro:Bit and Scottie Go!, to using Minecraft as much more than just a fun game, to learning to write persuasively to present your project in the best way possible, STEAM makes all of human knowledge come together.\n\n\n\nTaking digital learning to the next level\nWhat makes some educational solutions more successful than others?\nThe keywords to a successful implementation are simplicity, scalability and integration, in order to offer a seamless experience with minimal hassle on your or the students?? part.\nWhatever a teacher is willing to embrace, it must have a plug-and-play approach and make it easy to find, or better yet create, a unique journey to education.\nWhat makes these times exciting is that all these possibilities can be unlocked and centered on a single device, the teacher??s laptop, the key to open all doors to knowledge and really change the game.\nAt Acer we strongly believe the innate value of these fresh and exciting teaching resources will further empower our educators and bring about a new digital era for our schools.\nIn order to support their journey, we are committed to collaborate with the most valuable partners and promote their solutions, turning your device into a trusted companion of your life in the classroom.\n??It is teachers with technology that will make the difference??

Showing your prospective employer that you can think outside the box and be flexible and creative when faced with unexpected problems is more likely to put you on a fast track to a senior level career with much better salary prospects than a lower-level job that relies on following instructions more than on independent thinking.\nEven outside of these practical concerns for their students?? future, however, an overwhelming 97% of teachers acknowledge that creative problem-solving is important for them to learn in school, for their own accomplishment if not for better results in standardised testing. In a world where creativity is more and more important, in fact, even the content of international testing is undergoing a shift: leading organisations such as UNESCO are advocating for the promotion of creativity in schools and even PISA (OECD) will assess the test-takers?? ??creative thinking?? starting in 2021, rather than stopping at skills such as mathematics and reading comprehension.\n\n\nMaking dreams come true with ConceptD\n\nThanks to the new premium brand ConceptD, Acer is taking steps to support creativity in education by offering a full portfolio of mobile and desktop solutions designed by creators, for creators, along with a designed vertical ecosystem that promotes collaboration with several partners, so that design students can make their dreams come true in more ways than one.\nConceptD is primarily conceived with the aim of making creative concepts a reality. With ISV (Independent Software Vendor) partnerships as one of the greatest strong points of the extensive network of alliances, ConceptD can be a great tool for design students to gain valuable experience using professional software (among them, Adobe, Autodesk, Dassault Systemes, and Magix) that may one day help them advance in their ideal careers.\nFor an example of the benefits such an ecosystem may bring, look no further than IED (Istituto Europeo di Design), whose students have spent the past few months participating in the Design Innovation Lab, making the most of their new ConceptD products to conceive and develop new usage scenarios and an innovative design language for the future Acer Creator notebooks. Here??s a sneak peek of ??Litterae??, the winning project from team DEM!\nBut this is only a small fraction of what it means to be a part of ConceptD??s unique vertical ecosystem, which also includes our community of channel partners as well as alliance partners so as to offer complete, market-leading solutions for specific objectives and ensure the education community receives the finest value-added solutions.\n\nAre you a design school or a professional reseller interested in our ConceptD ecosystem?

Predator PCs were meant for gaming, but it was found that 15% of Predator users were not gaming at all. What were they doing, then, if not using their Predator PC for the task it was designed for? The answer, it seems, is that they were getting creative: 50% of them were found to be using both games and creative software, which is hardly surprising, as both tasks require a good amount of computing power, especially when it comes to demanding work such as 3D modelling.\nBut sheer power is not all that creators were asking for, and that is where ConceptD comes in. It was evident there was an untapped need for a specific brand for PC users who were mainly interested in doing creative work, and ConceptD was designed to meet that need: a range of workstation level products and mobile devices both, to satisfy creators whether they preferred to work in an office or on the go, which would address specific problems brought up in user interviews.\n\n\nConceptD: designed to be beautiful, inside and out\n\nOther categories may put performance first and looks second, but it was only natural for the creative community to have an eye for the exterior design of their devices. Who else but artists and designers should be concerned about having a machine that can handle their work while remaining aesthetically pleasing and fit for any environment, not too ??gamey?? at first glance, and with a consistent look that makes monitor, laptop, desktop and accessories look like they belong together?\nWith a clean, elegant, timeless design that will go well with any room while remaining practical and ergonomic, ConceptD is a brand with a distinctive heart and soul that will seamlessly become a part of your home or office space: its power is packed into a distinctive MAO (Micro-Arc Oxidation) ceramic finish, giving the brand a unique ultra-hard crystalline ceramic layer for superior strength and resistance, without forgoing a classy touch.\nBut just as clothes do not make the man, exterior design does not make a computer. Before ConceptD, creators were heard complaining that their machines lacked performance stability, that good performance tended to come with drawbacks such as noise and overheating, or that the work that looked perfect on screen turned out to be disappointing in real life due to poor colour accuracy.\nIn designing ConceptD, these voices were heard. From PANTONE? Validated screens to get every shade picture-perfect, to a vortex flow thermal solution that keeps the devices quiet and cool, ConceptD does its level best to meet the highly specific needs of creative users: even the noise reduction keyboard is designed to lessen the sound of your own typing and offer you handy shortcuts to your trusty creative apps.\nA shining example of the effort to fulfil the creative community??s wishes is the stunning precision of the ConceptD CP7 monitor. With 99% Adobe? RGB gamut, Delta E <1 colour accuracy, and 93% DCI-P3, it is sure to meet even the highest standards, guaranteeing that there is no limit to your imagination and that the difference between the concept seen on your screen and the real-life product will be next to invisible.\n\n\nProduct spotlight: ConceptD 7 Ezel\n\nNo product exemplifies the ConceptD brand better than ConceptD 7 Ezel.\nIts 10th Generation Intel? Core? i7 processor and up to NVIDIA? GeForce? RTX 2080 SUPER? with Max-Q Design graphics put the power to create at your fingertips, and anything you imagine will be shown in living colour on a 15.6? PANTONE? Validated 4K UHD display, but perhaps the feature that makes it most distinctive is that its name was not given on a whim.\nBuilt with specially designed hinges, this laptop is a digital easel that will let graphics artists of all descriptions sketch, finalize and present on one single device, switching among five usage modes: share, float, standard, pad, or display. Explore them all as you work with your Wacom EMR pen to make your designs a reality: with this all-in-one mobile solution for your artistic needs, the world is your canvas.\nIf you would like to know more about the ConceptD brand, please feel free to write us at acerforeducation.emea@acer.com.

In turn, this will give students an easier learning experience and a greater support network should they ever encounter difficulties on their path to knowledge.\nSkooler can also encourage and support the involvement of students?? families through the Parent/Guardian Portal and the related mobile app, so that parental figures can be notified of their children??s progress wherever they are and take an active role in the three-way partnership that education should ideally be. If it is to be successful, education requires a bond of trust and a willingness to work together on the part of all three of its equally important protagonists: students, teachers, and families. Take away one from the equation, and it becomes much harder for the new generation??s full potential to be realised.\nThat is why Skooler begins as a toolset for teachers, but its ultimate goal is to connect all three players into one cohesive whole; partnering with Acer was the ideal step to take in order to get closer to that goal.\n\n\nAn all-in-one solution\n\n\nBuilt exclusively for Office 365 Education and hosted in Microsoft Azure, Skooler is the perfect addition to any teacher??s and student??s Windows computer.\nThat is why an Acer Windows device equipped with Office 365 Education, Acer Classroom Manager, and the full range of Skooler Learning Management tools is the ultimate solution for educators to keep all their teaching resources in one place, maximising engagement with students and families while at the same time reducing complexity in their day-to-day procedures: imagine managing your assignments, lesson plans and communication with your students?? parents without multiple logins and applications to juggle.\n??Building a collaboration partnership with Acer and their key education Solution Centres will allow us to jointly expand our reach into many new countries and opportunities,?? says Tor Ove Henriksen, CEO of Skooler. ??We welcome Acer to the Skooler Partner family??.\n??Thanks to the partnership with Skooler, we will be able to offer a seamless all in one solution to our education customers,?? says Massimiliano Rossi, Acer EMEA Product Business Unit Vice President. ??Our mission is to bring innovative technologies to schools supporting educators to create the learning environments where students can develop the skills they need for their future.

Dynamism, design, discovery, detail, development, or indeed, the dimensions of your work, be they two or three: ConceptD offers all of this and more, making it the perfect companion for any creative job?Xand creative jobs are not limited to art!\nCreative thinking can be found in unexpected places: an artist??s studio may be the obvious place to look for it, but you can find creative minds among engineers and data analysts as well. Thinking outside the box is what truly separates humans from machines, which makes it even more important now that automation is becoming a very real concern in the job market. The more creative your job, the less likely you are to be replaced by a machine someday?Xwhich does not mean you should not rely on the right machines to make it easier!\nWhatever your chosen field, from photography and video editing, to 3D animation and architecture, to engineering and big data analysis, ConceptD is a new approach to computing that will give you all the power and mobility you need to be always on the move without sacrificing essential needs such as storage, flexibility and cross-compatibility with a number of different creative software.\n\n\nConceptD Portfolio\n\nConceptD offers a full range of products to upgrade your creative workstation or even build it from scratch: whether you prefer a mobile solution to work on the go, a stationary one to give your office a boost, or you just wish to move on to a better display that will make your creative endeavours pop, ConceptD has what you need.\nConceptD CM2, CM3, CP3, and CP7 monitors are all built to the highest available standards: they are all Pantone validated and offer high colour accuracy and a wide range of shades for you to pick your colours with the utmost precision.\nIf your workstation is not going anywhere anytime soon, you might want to look into ConceptD??s stationary products: ConceptD CM100, CT500, and CT700 are each designed with a combination of power and elegance in mind and, as a bonus, are fully equipped to stay quiet and cool no matter what your latest creative project puts them through. Choose the option that suits you best depending on your specific craft??s needs and how serious you are about working in a creative field professionally: each ConceptD product is a step further on the road to the top performances on the market and it is up to you to decide where to stop on that road.\nIf the whole world is your office, the best choice for your creative endeavours is one of ConceptD??s mobility solutions: ConceptD 5, ConceptD 7, ConceptD 7 Ezel and ConceptD 9 pack all of the brand??s power, sleek design, and attention to colour into the portability of a laptop, and the latter two even feature specially built hinges that will let you tilt the screen at your preferred angle for the best use of a Wacom EMR pen?Xjust like a painter??s easel.\nAnd even if you only wish to accessorize, let ConceptD surprise you with its full set of mouse, leather mousepad, Bluetooth mechanical keyboard, and rolltop backpack, so you can be stylish and comfortable at home or on the road.\n\n\nISVs Partnership\n\nWith the ConceptD brand, Acer is making sure to address every creator??s number one concern: will my trusty software work on my new computer? Every creative field has one or more go-to software that designers and artists need on a daily basis, and Acer recognises the value of ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) and has set up a rigorous testing process to ensure that most commonly used software in all creative professions will work smoothly on ConceptD products. Furthermore Acer partners with vertical ISVs such as Adobe, Autodesk, Dassault Systemes and Magix to offer market-leading solutions to the education community.\n\n\nConceptD in Education\nISVs are a valuable part of the Acer for Education of ecosystem focus on ConceptD which on top includes channel partners, alliances, Universities & design schools, institutions in order to ensure the education community receives the finest value-added solutions to support the creators of tomorrow.\nAcer for Education commitment is proved by several projects started recently with a number of University in Europe. IED (Istituto Europeo di Design) is one of them. Students from the three-year IED courses of the School of Visual Arts, Design together with Alumni of the Master course in Design Innovation, Strategy and Product have been involved in the Design Innovation Lab, with the aim of conceiving and developing new usage scenarios and an innovative design language for the future Acer Creator notebooks.\nCheck back on our social media on May 15 to see what these young minds have been capable of in these fruitful months of working alongside ConceptD!'),

Let??s explore how teachers can get the most out of what Google has to offer.\n\n\nTurn your class into a team with G Suite for Education\n\nG Suite for Education includes multiple tools to make school life easier and more exciting, but there is one thing most of the services on offer have in common: G Suite for Education is designed for collaborative work. From editing other students?? Google Docs, spreadsheets and Google Slides presentations, to setting up Team Drives to store the material for group projects, to participating in class-wide discussions on Google Classroom, where everyone can receive teacher feedback and make sure their voices are heard, the main goal of G Suite for Education is to turn your class into an efficient team.\nLet it never be said that working from home through technology is an isolating practice that deprives students of the chance to work together: if anything, accessing Google Classroom and other shared tools from outside the school premises and discussing school projects live on Google Hangouts is an excellent way to get them acclimated from an early age to the kind of long-distance collaboration they may be required to engage in at work in their near future.\nEquipping each student with a personal Google Calendar and setting time limits so that shared documents can no longer be edited after the due date, moreover, leaves them no excuses to skip assignments or turn in work late and teaches them valuable lessons about responsibility and time management that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nG Suite for Education benefits: free, safe and secure\n\nSetting up a G Suite for Education account is easy, free, and a guarantee that your information is in good hands. After a 14-day waiting period to verify that your institution qualifies for an account (all not-for-profit, formally accredited educational institutions are eligible, whereas organisations such as public libraries and military academies, which provide educational services without boasting the title of school or university, may be better suited to G Suite for Non-profits), you will be granted access to G Suite for Education??s full range of tools from one easy-to-use admin account that grants you more control than simply equipping each student with a personal Google account.\nThere is a large amount of overlap between the tools offered by G Suite for Education and a personal Google account, but G Suite for Education is a safer, more suitable option for classroom use.\nThe availability of the education-specific application Google Classroom is not the only major difference between the two sets of tools: G Suite for Education ensures that all material and software students can access is age-appropriate and not distracting by offering teachers the ability to enable and disable single tools in the suite as they see fit, effectively offering different, custom versions of the suite to different age and class groups in the same institution. This is an easy way to make sure that younger, easily distracted pupils stay on task and are denied access to tools that they cannot yet be trusted to use responsibly.\nIf you are concerned about privacy, moreover, you may be interested in knowing that while Google does collect information about the usage of G Suite for Education user accounts in order to provide basic services such as Gmail, Docs, Sheets and Slides, the school has a good degree of control about what personal information to share with the provider and Google??s aim is to keep the G Suite for Education experience ad-free and secure, giving faculty members the opportunity to exchange encrypted emails in case they contain sensitive student data.\nWith a world of tools at your fingertips in one easy solution, G Suite for Education is an excellent way to bring your class into the digital era once and for all.'),

The only risk you are running with TravelMate Spin B3 is confusing your ballpoint pen with the dockable stylus: after all, with Wacom AES technology, writing feels just as natural with one or the other.\nGear up for school with a TravelMate B3 device that is guaranteed to be your mate throughout all the ups and downs of classroom life and let Microsoft 365 Education open new doors for your education: together, they will take your learning further than ever before.'),

Pause for a moment and think about how you arrived at your answer ?V 10 x 5 + 8 x 5? Maybe 20 x 5 and minus 10? 9 x 5 x2? There are numerous routes to this answer, and many of us will approach the problem and path to its solution very differently. This particular sum is based on a classroom experiment carried out by the mathematician Jo Boelar. In her experiment she simply asked that question to a class of 30 students, then provided digital tools to allow each student to show how they arrived at the answer. The result? 14 different ways.

The result? The Interactive Whiteboard and the trusty calculator.\nIt??s easy to see why, but it??s not enough. Subjects like maths and science should be leading the charge to showing effective technology for learning. Why? Think back to our 18??5 question ?V only by using technology can we provide a platform that allows students to explore and express maths in a way that is personal to them, and only by using technology can we provide a canvas to allow students to be creative with maths and build context. Sure, there??s pen and paper ?V and some students will stick with these tools, but others will want to engage through technology, and so we need to understand how.\nThere??s a range of fantastic tools that can help when partnered with Chromebook and Laptop ?V solutions like Geogebra open up graphing and 3D calculations, and EquatIO allows students ways to include written maths, graphs or even dictate or handwrite maths using a touch screen.\nWe??ve been used to a world of in-built equation editors. Difficult to learn, they??ve been the preserve of higher end maths for many years. Which may be why the reluctance to integrate devices into maths based subjects at other levels. That??s not the case any longer ?V the tools, the technology and the pedagogy now enable us to deepen learning, build better understanding of the language of maths and develop logical and critical thinking ?V for any age of students from early years to higher education.\nThe right vision and plan help us build much wider use of our digital devices and ensures that no subject is left behind.\n\nIf you would like to know more about these topics, please feel free to write us at acerforeducation.emea@acer.com.

Let??s look at a few interesting ways physical education teachers can integrate technology into their activities.\n\n\n1.      Tracking progress\n\nFitness apps and devices are all the rage among those who want to keep track of their diet and exercise routines, so why not apply the same principle to physical education? From smartwatches to free phone apps, teachers can encourage students to track their progress and foster a healthy amount of competition between classmates and, most importantly, with themselves?Xas long as they remember not to let it go to extremes. Neglecting exercise and a healthy diet is a risk, but so is restricting food intake too much and overexerting yourself, and the role of a teacher is to remind students that even with an app that tracks your fitness wherever you go, it should not become an obsession.\n\n\n2.      Setting reasonable goals\n\nIn the world of physical activity, not everyone is equal. Age, gender and fitness level are all factors that determine a person??s ability to complete athletic tasks: having to meet unreasonable goals can be extremely humiliating and discouraging, not to mention damage a student??s grades. With devices that track your heart rate during exercise, a teacher can adapt fitness goals to the needs and capabilities of each student and grade them accordingly, which makes physical education class less intimidating, eliminates the risk of P.E. being the one stain on an otherwise excellent report card, and, if handled wisely, even makes the class one less potential source of bullying.\n\n\n3.      Self-improvement\n\nExercise, nutrition and professional sports are hot topics on YouTube, and even pro players watch their own games as a way to do better next time. Between encouraging students to watch video demonstrations done by professionals and having them play back recordings of their own performances to spot weaknesses and study new ways to improve, video is a powerful self-improvement tool. As long as the videos have been vetted by the teacher as age-appropriate and free of potentially damaging content, students can learn from them and find some good, healthy role models to emulate.\n\n\n4.      Exercising outside school\n\nFor some students, physical education is the only time they exercise at all; for others, it is not. The difference in performance between students who play sports outside of school hours and those who do not is immediately evident, especially in those countries whose schools do not generally offer good sports programs, leaving organisations other than school as the only option for young people to play competitively. Fitness apps and devices can thus become a way to make school sports and sports played by yourself or with external organisations come together: if students can prove they have exercised for a given number of hours other than the school-mandated classes with screenshots and other technology-based data, schools can, if legally possible in their country, make exercise done on the students?? own time count towards their physical education grade, which not only gives a more realistic assessment of each student??s actual aptitude for sports, but also teaches them that exercise and a healthy lifestyle can and should stay with them their whole lives, not just in one single class.\n\n\n5.      Active video games\n\nVideo games are usually seen as taking away from the time young people spend exercising, but there is a genre that encourages physical activity: from music-based games where the goal is to dance, to sports simulators where the controller becomes a tennis racquet or similar, we already possess the technology to track movement in real time and translate it to a screen in fun, engaging ways that make physical activity less of a chore. Investing in such gaming consoles can be a viable option to get students to move, especially when the school lacks an indoor gym and has physical education classes take place outside, where they can be disrupted by bad weather.');

This includes equipping it with antivirus software, choosing strong passwords and changing them frequently, not downloading any material that looks suspicious, and learning not to be fooled by pop-ups and other false advertising. On school-issued devices, this is a joint effort between students, who have the responsibility to behave appropriately, and adults, who are tasked with choosing the best protective software for the school??s needs and budget.\n\n\n2- Research done right\n\nA prime occasion to discuss Internet safety is the use of the Web for research projects. When students use the wealth of information available on the Internet for learning purposes, teachers would do well to remind them that not everything you see on the Internet is true and it takes skill to cobble together material from different sources without being deceived by incorrect or deliberately false information or plagiarizing.\nDiscussing how to recognize a good source of information, how to cite sources and how to avoid copyright infringement is essential, especially if your students intend to move on to higher education or to make a living publishing content on the Internet.\n\n\n3- New kinds of bullying?Xand how to prevent them\n\nThe feeling of anonymity can play tricks on a user??s mind. Hiding behind a username, we sometimes say and do things we would never do in person.\nCyberbullying is the new and, in some ways, crueller form of torment that school-aged boys and girls inflict on one another: it may not cause bodily injuries, but it is much more pervasive in that it can follow you outside school grounds and leave an indelible mark on your reputation.\nSexting, the exchange of sexually explicit material online, can also become a serious threat. What begins as an activity between two young people exploring their sexuality can easily turn into blackmail and shaming.\nIt is a teacher??s responsibility to ensure that students understand that the person at the other end of the connection is still a person with feelings that deserve to be respected. Educators can only create a safe environment by taking reports of cyberbullying seriously: students must be made to feel that they can talk about it freely and without fear of retaliation or dismissal.\n\n\n4- First impressions\n\nYou never get a second chance to make a first impression.\nAlthough these words have been variously attributed, changing their authorship does not change their meaning, and they are more valid than ever in a world where the first impression you make is often your online self-image rather than your person.\nWhat others see and think about you online is only a selection of the aspects that make up the whole of yourself, and it is a selection that should be made very carefully.\nStudents should be trained to see the Internet as a global blackboard that can never be erased: if you make a mistake on the board, covering your tracks is as easy as wiping the chalk or marker off, but if you make a mistake on the Internet, such as posting something that gives an undesirable impression, a trace will always be available to those who know where to look.\nBecause we are now exposed to the Internet from an early age, a modern adult??s online self-image is years in the making and includes everything they have posted even in their childhood or teenage years, which are not a period of time known for good decisions. That is why young people must be guided in their use of the Internet and reminded that what they post now will affect their careers later. This is especially important towards the end of a K-12 education, when students are beginning to think about entering the workforce.\nThat said, we must not forget that cybersecurity is a skill, not a burden, and that it should be taught in a positive manner without making our children paranoid about every step they take on the Internet.'),

This power also lets students collaborate on school projects, run multiple apps and stream educational videos with ease. With up to 12 hours of battery life, students can expect a full day of usage on one charge.\nThe Acer Chromebook 712 is not only durable enough to meet the stringent U.S. MIL-STD 810G military standards, it??s also tough enough to handle even the most energetic students. It has a reinforced hinge that remains intact even when students pick it up by the display, which was intentionally designed to provide extra flexibility.\nIt can also withstand up to 60 kg (132 pounds) of downward force, so it??s protected if a student steps on it or smashes it in a backpack. Its reinforced design and shock-absorbing bumper even lets it handle drops from heights of up to 122 cm (48 inches). Also suitable for younger students, the new Acer Chromebook 712 is certified to meet two leading toy safety standards: the ASTM F963-16 and UL/IEC 60950-1.\nThe keyboard was designed with active students in mind. It has mechanically anchored keys that are difficult to remove but easy to replace, making them ideal for classroom environments. The keyboard also protects against spills of up to 330 ml (11 fluid ounces) of water thanks to a gutter system that routes water out the bottom of the chassis. Even the touchpad is moisture-resistant.\n\nDisplay Boosts Learning\n\nThe new Acer Chromebook 712 will boost learning with a 3:2 aspect ratio that gives students 18 percent more vertical space compared to an equally wide 16:9 display. As a result, they can read more information and view more images, such as maps and diagrams, before needing to scroll. The 12-inch display features a HD+ 1366 x 912 resolution and IPS technology. It is available with either a touch- (C871T) or non-touch (C871) display option.\nThe Acer Chromebook 712 can be opened a full 180 degrees, letting it lay flat on a desk for sharing with other students during classes or for school projects.

Most people outside of the teaching profession do not realise how much time a good educator spends worrying about what they will say or do in class the next day, but the truth of the matter is that what happens in the classroom is only the tip of the iceberg.\nWith the increasing tendency to tailor lessons to each individual student??s needs and leave behind the ??one size fits all?? model, the initial impression is that teachers?? work has suddenly multiplied and they need to come up not just with one plan, but as many plans as there are students?Xa frankly horrifying prospect that is not sustainable in the long term and would require the teacher to be in multiple places at once, holding several parallel lessons at the same time.\nHow can EdTech make this possible?\n\n\nPlay the lesson plan to your students?? strengths\n\nTechnology can be a great help in making lesson plans more flexible and effective, and none of it involves far-fetched solutions such as cloning teachers so they can give students individual attention: that still belongs in science fiction and will remain there for a long time to come.\nOne simple way to use technology to make learning personalised is to make the most of the multimedia capabilities of the technological devices the students are using: when the same device can produce a written text, a static visual representation of the concepts they??ve learnt, or even a short video, there are multiple valid ways to complete the same assignment. A student who is shy about public speaking might turn in an excellent written piece; conversely, someone who struggles to express themselves in writing might record themselves explaining the same information and prove that they have a solid understanding of it. This is not to say that students should never practice what they are not good at: personalised learning, if done incorrectly, can turn into catering to the student??s every whim, fail to give them a well-rounded education, and leave them ill-equipped to deal with failure in life. In short, true personalised learning requires great skill on the teacher??s part to distinguish between making students practice something they dislike and forcing them to go against their very nature.\nGroup projects also have great potential: not only do they foster teamwork and sometimes put students in the position of having to work with someone they would not have collaborated with otherwise, improving their skills in the areas of empathy and resolution of conflict, but they also help them figure out what their place in the team is: are they a natural leader or a follower? Are they willing to be the spokesperson for the entire group on the day the project is to be shown to the class, or do they prefer to work behind the scenes? Do their talents lie in researching information or in presenting it in an effective way? A good team is the sum of a lot of different roles and each student should find the one that suits them best.\n\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nIt is clear by now that the true way to personalised learning for a class of twenty students is not to make twenty separate plans, but one plan that has something for each of those twenty people. Some may be content with a traditional lecture, others may prefer to learn through a video, others yet may benefit the most from using learning apps that offer a hands-on experience: experimenting with all modes of learning will offer something of value to everyone. Visual learners may be bored during the lecture, auditory learners may struggle to excel at practical assignments?Xthat is all part of a varied, multimedia lesson plan. What truly matters is that with well-executed personalised learning, each type of student knows their turn will come sooner or later and that no way of learning is superior to another.\nWith the aid of technology, a lesson plan is no longer a bitter medicine that everyone has to swallow, but a template with plenty of room for individual variations that allows every student to find their own personal path to success.\n\n'),

Let??s look at both sides of the debate.\n\n\nWhat is gaming disorder?\n\nAt first glance, it appears that those who fear their children will be glued to the screen all day have the World Health Organisation on their side: in 2018, the WHO recognised gaming disorder as a legitimate set of addictive behaviours in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). However, if we look a little deeper, we find that the WHO??s proclamation may not be as worrying as it sounds.\n\nFirstly, gaming disorder is not a common mental health condition. True addiction to video games and Internet games (Internet gaming disorder, a similar but separate classification that has yet to be fully acknowledged by the American Psychiatric Association) are not as widespread as we may think: IGD only affects 1% of the population at most.\n\nThis is because the criteria to distinguish a passion for gaming from an addiction are very strict: when dealing with a suspected case of gaming disorder, we must remember that not all enthusiastic gamers are necessarily addicted. To qualify for a gaming disorder diagnosis, one must display a lack of control on their gaming habits that has lasted for at least a year and disrupted their family and social relationships and their education or work, taking priority over all other aspects of their life. However avidly one may play, if there is a balance between their gaming activities and the rest of their lives, they do not suffer from true gaming disorder.\n\nLastly, and perhaps more importantly, if video games are negatively affecting someone??s life, we should consider that they may not be the primary cause of the problem. If someone withdraws into obsessive gaming and refuses to have a healthy social life, it is worth looking into other issues before pointing fingers: rather than the origin of their troubles, video games may be a coping mechanism for depression or anxiety, and proper treatment for the root of the apparent addiction may also alleviate the gaming disorder symptoms.\n\nBut how can teachers make sure their students?? relationship with gaming remains healthy and assuage their parents?? fears?\n\n\n\nPlaying responsibly\n\nThe most important keyword teachers should keep in mind if they intend to introduce gaming in their curriculum is moderation: it is vitally important to find a middle ground between banning video games altogether and using them indiscriminately to the detriment of other activities.\n\nIt is counterproductive for teachers to contribute to a potential moral panic about video game addiction: if they adopt a zero-tolerance policy, they may in fact make gaming appear even more appealing simply because it has been forbidden by an authority figure!\n\nOn the other hand, teachers should promote a responsible use of video games by making students aware of the risks connected to their abuse and encouraging them to limit their amount of time spent playing so that their health and schoolwork do not suffer, and most of all, they should educate themselves on which games are most suitable to a school environment. Teachers have little to no control on their students?? gaming habits outside of the classroom, so they cannot personally make sure that the games they play at home are age-appropriate and proven to be beneficial to their cognitive development, but they do have a say in which gaming titles are used in class and may even guide students towards better, healthier choices of games as well as help regulate their screen time and reduce the risk of addiction.\n\nIn this, as in many other aspects of a student??s life, a teacher??s role is one of guidance: a good educator should neither blindly reject the world of gaming, nor leave students to fend for themselves in it, but rather be a helping hand that shows them the way.'),

How are teachers supposed to make children ready for their future careers when the facts they are teaching will no longer be true and the technology they are using will already be old by the time they finish?\nIt is a daunting task, but technology, even if it risks being obsolete by the time they graduate, can be an invaluable tool to help the students of today become the workers of tomorrow. Let??s explore how.\n\n\n1.      A level playing field\n\nThe gap between school and work is not the only one technology can bridge. Before we can even think of starting students down the road to a successful career, there are other obstacles to take care of?Xnamely, that not all students begin the race to the job market from the same starting point. It may be because a disability is affecting their academic success, their social skills, or even their physical capabilities, or it may be because an economically disadvantaged situation is affording them fewer opportunities to expand their worldview and acquire valuable skills, but not all new graduates are equally palatable to employers?Xthat is, unless we create occasions for them that they otherwise would not have. Compensating for learning disabilities, giving students a taste of places and experiences beyond their budget, even giving them the means to start a booming online business that does not require them to be able-bodied or well-off to begin with: those are only a few examples of the ways technology can make the world a fairer place.\n\n\n2.      Creating connections\n\nOur school system is the product of the first industrial revolution: a learning model based on large class groups all learning the same material was ideal to produce great masses of new factory workers. Before this teaching style dominated the modern world, however, the commonly accepted method of training was through apprenticeships: young people would go learn a skill directly from a master through observation and practice. With technology, it is not unfeasible to go back to a new and more updated form of this ancient model: if there is one thing technology does well, it is to create connections between people, so why should it not create connections between schools and companies or institutions willing to provide instruction, and subsequently internships and job openings? Let students supplement their education with online courses from the leaders in their chosen field, give them the chance to create a network of useful contacts, and they will have no shortage of career opportunities.\n\n\n3.      From theory to practice\n\nSpeaking of learning through practice, overly focusing on theory is one of the main flaws of textbook-based education, one that EdTech can remedy. One of the greatest complaints of new graduates who are facing the real world for the first time is that school did not prepare them for what was ahead; but what if it could? From learning practical skills in a safe setting with MR and simulators of all descriptions to providing more realistic applications of their theoretical knowledge through educational apps and games designed with a problem-solving approach, EdTech can radically rethink the way we learn and teach and create a generation that is much more prepared to take on the challenges of life.\n\n\n4.      Learning more than facts\n\nAn effective education is about more than memorising facts. Now more than ever, we need to be aware that the content we give our students may no longer be valid by the time they have to use it. Teaching them reading, writing and arithmetic is all well and good, but what they need is adaptability, and in today??s world, adaptability comes in the form of soft skills. Thanks to technology, students can work in teams without meeting face to face, have tools that support their creative endeavours, and improve their communication abilities: all skills that will serve them well across any career and help them learn new things on the fly if the need arises, making them better equipped for the ever-changing job market.'),

Identify time wasters\n\nWhile technology aims at saving time, it can also lead to wasting it?Xhow many times have you spent hours browsing Facebook and wondered where that time had gone?\nIt might be a good idea for teachers to use a monitoring app to track their usage of mobile devices to find and eliminate the factors that are a drain on their time.\n\n\n2.      Plan ahead\n\nDo you have a thousand things to do and only twenty-four hours to do them? This is a common feeling and teachers are not the only professionals who are plagued by it, but there are plenty of apps to plan your day, your week, even your school year so that you can set goals and prioritise urgent tasks?Xand as a bonus, you will never be late for anything.\n\n\n3.      Invest time now, save time later\n\nIntegrating technology into their teaching methods can feel daunting, especially to those who have been behind the teacher??s desk since before the invention of EdTech and still perceive it as a novelty: at first, teachers may feel like EdTech is wasting more time than it saves because it is taking them a long time to learn how to use it, but the trick is to see it as an investment rather than a waste. Set realistic expectations proportionate to your school??s resources on how and how much you can implement EdTech in your classroom, seek help from more skilled colleagues, and you will find that the time you are ??wasting?? now will be given back to you later.\n\n\n4.      Analyse data faster\n\nData analysis is one of the tasks technology is best at, and when the lectures are over, teachers find themselves doing a lot of it too: examining student performances to find weaknesses, for example, is a process that can be long and tedious and encroach on the time to plan the next lessons. But if you no longer have to do it manually and technology identifies in seconds the struggles that you would have found in minutes or hours, it frees up a lot of time to finish your other duties.\n\n\n5.      Administration made easy\n\nA teacher??s job is not just made of lessons: there is marking, planning the content of your next lectures, dealing with a number of administrative tasks?Xand there are also numerous apps available for each of these. You can administer tests and give assignments that are graded automatically, create flowcharts and notes or download ready-made plans and exercises; just find what works best for you.\n\n\n6.      Communication is key\n\nSocial media is not just a distraction: technology has made it easier than ever to communicate with each other, so a judicious use of Facebook and WhatsApp can be a great tool to share relevant information with both students and parents so that nobody misses out on important announcements and you can foster an environment of three-way cooperation and trust between the key players of a good education?Xteachers, students and families.\n\n\n7.      Teacher collaboration\n\nSpeaking of communication, the ease of long-distance connections has created a global community of teachers that can save everyone considerable time: imagine having some of your work already done by a colleague halfway across the world who is willing to share lesson plans and material that work just as well for you.\n\n\n8.      Let students do the work\n\nTechnology can also significantly expedite and enhance the practices of peer tutoring and peer-to-peer marking: students can easily evaluate their own and each other??s work and learn from one another anywhere, anytime, thus taking some of the burden off the teacher??s shoulders and developing a better understanding of the quality standards they are expected to reach.\nEven in a world that seems to move faster and faster, there are countless options at your fingertips to keep up with our fast-paced lives, if you know where to look?Xand with technology, the answer to the conundrum is often in your pocket.'),

This generate a positive reaction in the students, who feel more engaged with their classmates, with teachers and the subjects taught by them, and in the long term this increasing engagement reflects on a higher effectiveness of the classroom experience.\n\n\nHow to overturn lessons through gaming approach\n\nGame-based learning (GBL) is a learning method that leverages on the use of games as a part of the learning process, in order to enhance the classroom experience of the students. Using competitive exercises characterized by fantasy elements, Game-based learning carries pupils into virtual environments with clear characteristics: they are safe to make students feel comfortable, and inside them, students have to teach established goals by taking actions, making mistakes and experience the consequences (in a risk-free situation).\nGame-based learning is quite different from gamification, which consists in applying some game elements to a non-game situation: for example, implementing a scoring game mechanic to reward users for certain behaviors, so to have an alternative to the traditional grading system.\nHowever, both these new teaching approaches are more and more effective in making young students more engaged during their classroom lessons, contributing to develop fundamental soft skills such as critical thinking and problem solving.\n\n\nDisruptive technologies to maximize students?? attention\n\nMixed Reality merges real elements with virtual worlds creating the so-called phygital environments, where the boundaries among physical and digital objects are very fleeting. An HMD (head mounted display) and a motion controller are enough to access to a mix of real and virtual worlds and to allow students to interact with this Mixed Reality environment.\nThis innovative technology is gaining a growing  space in education process, as we have seen with two important success stories that have Acer Windows Mixed Reality Headset as protagonist, coming from United Kingdom and Czech Republic schools. And it??s not difficult to guess why Mixed Reality is so appreciated, especially by students: it offers a whole immersive learning experience, with pupils able to explore foreign countries or to go through the solar system?Kwithout leaving the classroom!\n\n\nImplementing flexible teaching approaches\n\n??One size fits all?? is an outdated teaching method, educators can no longer apply it in classroom filled with students with different learning and knowledge background. Nowadays Education Technology offers many solutions in terms of devices and especially approaches that allows teachers to overtake conventional education methods and to cater to each student??s specific need.\nDevices like Acer Chromebooks or Acer Chromebook Tab10, along with specific tools as Google Suite for Education and Office365 Suite and along with cloud technology, enable teachers to promote interactive learning methods with a high personalization rate. A personalized learning approach helps students to identify their weaknesses as well as their passions and talents, and so it supports teachers in building a personalized learning path that children will follow throughout their lives. In this way, any student can eventually reach the same level of knowledge of his classmates.\nThis approach is very similar to adaptive learning, which is an educational system based on technology and data analysis, which allows teachers to track students?? performance and adjust methods and programs to each learner??s needs.\nThese are both learner-centric approaches, where student plays an active role in the learning process, feeling more considered by his educators and more engaged in the definition of his study path and, in the long term, in the definition of his future.'),

There are many different methods, here are some of the most effective ones that can be easily implemented in the classroom:\n\n\n??The computer screen should be around 28 inches from the eyes. Getting too close to the screen as well as the position of the monitor could add to eye strain.\n??Teachers could consider asking the school to replace the light bulbs in the classroom to lower watt ones. The intensity of the light around and any glare on the screen from lamps or windows could cause long term problems.\n??It is recommended to adjust display settings to make sure the resolution is as high as possible. Brightness should match the surroundings as much as possible, and in bright environment it is always recommended to apply glare reduction filters.\n??Even smaller changes like adjusting text size and colour can have a positive impact. Text should be three times larger than the smallest one can read, and black text on a white background is always preferable.\n\n\n2- Know what to look for\n\nIt is very important for teachers to pay attention to their students?? habits and behaviours in class, as it allows them to immediately notice when something is wrong. When it comes to eye strain, we recommend teachers to look for these common and easy to spot early symptoms:\n\n??Frequent squinting when reading\n??Complaints of headaches\n??A sudden and unexplained drop in performance\n??Rubbing eyes\n??Losing place while reading and using a finger to maintain it\n\nLearning what to look for is a fundamental step to improve young students?? health and safety in the classroom.\n\n\n\n3- Talk to the parents\n\nIf a teacher notices any of the previously mentioned symptoms in one of their students, it??s important to contact the parents. No matter how proactive the school is at implementing prevention methods, the most effective changes are the ones students make at home. What teachers can do is recommending an eye exam and sharing some tips with the parents, to help them create a healthy environment and prevent further damage.\nEarly intervention can also help students whose grades are suffering, and risk falling through the cracks. It is easy to mistake eye strain symptoms with laziness and lack of effort. Dialogue between teachers and parents is essential, especially when it comes to younger children.\n\n\n4- Encourage alternative activities\n\nTechnology is becoming essential in modern education, but educators shouldn??t make the mistake of using it to replace other activities. Inviting guest speakers, encouraging student to lead discussions and debates, organizing field trips, and assigning craft projects will reduce the number of hours spent in front of a screen, without reducing interest and engagement. Digital detoxes are often necessary for young students to learn not to rely exclusively on technology, but also on real life experiences and interpersonal skills.\n\n\n5- Take breaks\n\nTaking frequent breaks from technology is a great way to protect eyes and mind. Sometimes it can be hard to know our limits when we stare at a laptop, and it is important to teach students that there is a time and place for everything. When it comes to younger children, technological devices should be limited to the classroom and not allowed during recess. It is considered to be good practice to take a 20-minute break every 20 minutes of screen time.'),

Simple tools like Google Drive, Evernote, Trello, and even Facebook can completely change the way teachers look at their job, so here are 6 ways EduTech can help increase productivity and save time.\n\n\n1 ?V Going paperless\n\nGoing paperless is the first step to take, the easiest way to reduce clutter and start fresh. It??s fast, easy, and environment friendly. Being able to keep everything in one place significantly improves overall organization and simplifies everyday tasks, such as making sure students are up to date with the material.\n\n\n2 ?V Computer-based testing\n\nThe main benefit of computer based testing is instant score report. It gives teachers an immediate overview of the class?? strengths and weaknesses, without any of the time spent grading. Computer based testing also allows students with disabilities will be able to take tests with everyone else, significantly reducing the time teachers would otherwise need to accommodate their needs. When it comes to large scale testing this method is particularly effective, making the whole process faster, cheaper, better organized, and easier on the staff.\n\n\n3 ?V Online assignments\nOnline assignments can be completed, updated, submitted and graded from anywhere at any time. They have clear deadlines and they can even be timed, allowing teachers to know exactly how much time it takes students to write a paper or to take a test. Even lesson planning can benefit from online assignments, as teachers will be able to integrate the topics student struggled with the most in their next class.\n\n\n4 ?V Lesson planning\n\nResearching content online is easier today than it??s ever been. This allows teachers to find and integrate videos and newspaper articles into their classes, significantly improving students?? engagement and encouraging them to interact with the content being shown. Studies have confirmed that showing videos in class will increase attention and even attendance, additionally the use of interactive material in class has been linked with higher memory retention rates.\nJust like computer based testing, also this method accommodates students with disabilities without requiring additional time.\n\n\n5 ?V Contacting parents\n\nThere are several apps and tools available to facilitate communication between teachers and parents. It has become increasingly simple for teachers to keep parents informed not only on their children??s grades but also on their behavior, attendance, and possible struggles. Other apps even allow parents to share medical information about their children, like allergies or health conditions, making it easier for the school to guarantee a safe and controlled environment.\n\n\n6 ?V Student-teacher communication\n\nThe most successful way to communicate with students online is using platforms they are already familiar with, like Facebook and WhatsApp. It will make it easier for them to always be up to date and engage with the group.\nThis method will ensure teachers will able to answer all students?? questions at once and in one place, giving them the time to address any doubt or concern. It will also make it easier to communicate and schedule changes, absences and special circumstances.'),

Teachers are required to play a key role in educating young students on how to use the Internet ?V and technology in general ?V in a responsible and safe way, in order to help them build a strong awareness of opportunities and threats of cyberspace.\n\n\nWhy is teaching students about cyber security so important?\n\nToday??s children and young students have the innate ability to navigate the Web and use technological devices. They are ??digital natives??, they were born into the digital age and have never known a world without the Internet. Kids and teens take technology classes every day, they surf the Web for their projects, and they use the Internet during their spare time too, playing online video games, sharing their experiences on social networks and doing all sorts of ??digital things??.\nChildren and teens see the Internet as a great big thing able to provide them with tons of answers and information about everything. They conceive the Web exclusively as a positive environment, without taking into consideration its flaws. In this case, parents and teachers play a fundamental role in making young students aware that, if they are not careful, people with bad intentions can ruin their online experience ?V exactly as it can happen in the ??real?? life.\n\n\nHow educators can introduce cybersecurity in the classroom\n\nCriminals have found new ways to break into our lives through our screens. If you are a teacher, you can play a key role, training your students to become responsible digital users, guiding them and educating them on how to practice appropriate behavior while they are using blogs and social networks, navigating wiki spaces, doing online research, and so on. Here are 4 important topics you can explore in your classroom to become cybersecurity advocates.\n\n\nProtection of technological devices\n\nToday??s students think about their technology equipment as something ??due??, something which is ??normal??. On the contrary, they should view it as a privilege. Teachers should raise awareness on the importance of taking care of digital devices because they are precious and not invincible. Students can be educated on being always alert and active when encountering suspicious messages, links, pop-up windows, to prevent their smartphones, laptops, and tablets from being infected with malware ?V such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses ?V that may attack while using email, blogs or social media.\n\n\nSafe sites for learning and research\n\nAs said before, today??s kids and teens conceive the Web as an immense storehouse of knowledge and answers. Diving into this large sea of information may make difficult for them to explore and choose the valid and credible one. At school, they should learn how to recognize trusted digital resources: for example, teachers can provide students with a list of approved Web sites to use in class, and give them advice on how to evaluate sites in order to make responsible decisions while surfing the Net.\n\n\nPrevention of Cyberbullying\n\n\nStudents have daily interactions with one another via chat rooms, blogs, and social networks. They are free to write about anything ?V and above all anyone ?V forwarding their opinions to many with just one click, also in an anonymous way. When these opinions are bad, when they damage the image of someone, when they hurt the sensibility of a victim, it is called cyberbullying. The consequences can be devastating, resulting in emotional stress, withdrawal from school, and even suicide.\nIt is fundamental to discuss the problem, and teachers can help defy this terrible behavior providing a set of guidelines to prevent and handle it. Students must be encouraged to report inappropriate online interactions to their parents, teachers, counselors, whether they are a victim or bystander. During their lessons, educators can provide examples of cyberbullying to help students understand the importance of addressing this concern and what is the boundary to be respected.\n\n\nThe importance of self-image\n\nStudents should be educated to the importance of ??thinking before posting??. They have to understand that once they post something online ?V a picture, an opinion, a video ?V they make it available for the world to see or read.\nEducators can help students promote a positive ??digital self-image?? through four simple questions they should ask themselves before posting:\n\n\n??Will this post affect my future career?\n??Will this post hurt anyone??s feelings?\n??How do I want to be seen by the others?\n??How will my parents feel if they read or see my post?\n\n\nThe Cyberkids Adventures: a practical example from Italy\n\nFor this academic year 2017-2018, Acer is supporting a special project called ??Le Avventure dei Cyberkid?? (??The Cyberkids Adventures??) to prevent cyberbullying in Italy by educating children and young students to a correct use of new technologies.\nThe project aims to increase the awareness ?V in both children and adults ?V to start considering the Web and the digital devices as important tools at our service, not to be feared or avoided.\n\nKids and teens receive a free educational kit at school, with important tips on how to use the Web properly. These tips are provided by SuperSpin and SwithGirl ?V the Cyberkids ?V two nice cartoon heroes who will guide the young students until the end of the academic year.\nThe cartoon heroes SuperSpin and SwitchGirl accompany the kids along the way.\n\nThe project, which uses a playful and creative method, is to be considered complementary to the educational path of prevention of cyberbullying, it is developed throughout Italy and it reaches teachers of 3,000 classes (about 75,000 students and their parents).'),

To better integrate it into the school experience, teachers have to be able to drive digital each aspect of the classroom daily life. Here are 7 ideas to do it in an easy, engaging way.\n\n\nWhy technology in classroom?\nFirst of all, let??s remember one more time why it is so important to integrate technology into the learning experience. Today, principals and school boards are requiring teachers to improve their lesson plans with technology because:\n\n??technology allows for differentiation. It is now clear that teachers don??t just teach a subject to a group of students: they transfer information to individuals with different learning skills, abilities and backgrounds. Differentiation is the technique to connect educational contents to the students taking into consideration their various needs;\n??through technological devices, students can learn at their own pace, whenever they want and from wherever they are;\n??students will need technology for college and career, so why not to start using it during their learning path at school?;\n??students really like and enjoy technology!\n\n\nCreate a class webpage\n\nThe first step to introduce technology into the learning experience can be the creation of a virtual version of what happens into the classroom through a class webpage. It can be anything from a basic website where to post various announcements to a more elaborate page where to include class photos, downloadable materials and documents, a class blog or digital magazine.\n\n\nDevelop a student made monthly slideshow\n\nA simple but great idea to engage students and create a useful document to share in the classroom. Every day, after the end of the lesson, one student summarizes the most important topics in just one sentence, also taking a picture or choosing a representative image, and add them to a slide. At the end of the month, the classroom will benefit from a student made, collaborative slideshow.\n\n\nUse an online grading system\n\nSchools are now shifting from paper gradebooks to their digital versions, but where this has not happened yet, it is possible to use apposite free websites to record attendance and seating charts, track grades, and compile reports on students?? progress and performances. Parents can also be informed on their children??s updated grades via email and students will never worry again about losing their gradebooks, accessing them from any computer or digital device connected to Internet.\n\n\nSkype an expert in classroom\n\nToday children and young students often ask for a direct learning experience: they need to look at what they??re studying very closely. Skype can help teachers to provide a ??live version?? of what they??re teaching: the classroom can get in touch with an expert in any field ?V a museum curator, a college professor, a scientist or a researcher ?V during the class, asking him questions and satisfying the curiosity in realtime. If we are talking about Literature lesson plans, Skype dedicates a website to connecting with authors: Skype an Author.\n\n\nManage a collaborative class blog\n\nWordPress, Blogger, Kidblog, Edublogs: plenty of opportunities are out there to set up a blog for the class. Blogging is an all-purpose activity that help students to develop different skills while having fun: writing, reading, speaking, listening, problem-solving, critical thinking, working together, are just some examples.\nStudents can express their thoughts with words, but also with images, colors, videos, multimedia and so on. Teachers can introduce blogging to their students and then let them organize, plan and self-monitor the activity, supervising them and watching them growing.\n\n\nLearning through videos\n\nVideo clips are a creative choice to break up the monotony of class while enriching the lesson with extra content from other non-conventional sources. BrainPOP, Youtube or TED are the most used online services to find interesting multimedia materials.\n\n\nMobile devices to optimize collaboration\n\nAn effective way to optimize collaboration is to let students use their mobile devices during group work. Students can get together working as a team where a ??spokesperson??, selected by the teacher, is in charge of collecting ideas using a smartphone or a tablet, which can be then used to show the results to the classroom, connecting it to a larger screen display.'),

Developing a Creative Learning approach, educators can use technology to activate, blend and strengthen multiple inner skills in their classrooms.\n\n\nCombining technology and creativity to create an immersive experience\n\nDuring their learning experience, students ?V above all children ?V often ask a lot of questions, they want to know more and more, and sometimes they may seek the possibility to try things for themselves, exploring them in a direct way. With traditional learning materials, such as text books for example, these possibilities are restricted.\nThe combination of technology and creativity is the key to provide the immersive experience students need. When teachers use technological devices to integrate their traditional lessons with sounds, projected images or lights, the positive reaction is guaranteed: students become more engaged, the understanding process in their minds is boosted and they begin making links and connections among concepts they??re receiving in a more tangible form.\nElectronic resources can be involved in a creative path to enhance any kind of activity at school. If computers and networks once seemed to be useful exclusively for subjects like Science and Maths, it is now clear that also non-technical fields can reap the benefits of digital tools. Drama, Geography, History, Writing courses become richer experiences when helped by dedicated audio equipments, technological gadgets or MR (mixed reality) videos.\n\n\nCreativity is the future: 5 tools to encourage Creative Learning\n\nSteve Jobs once said: ??The best way to create value in the 21st century is to connect creativity with technology??. And when this happens inside the classroom, it means that educators are preparing learners for their future in the most significant way. Here are 5 digital tools teachers can use during their lessons to nurture and encourage creative learning.\n\n\nWindows Ink\n\nStudies show that writing by hand boosts learning retention, much more than using a keyboard. For this reason, Windows Ink allows students to instantly write, sketch, highlight text and search handwritten notes in a very easy and accurate way. Furthermore, Windows Ink helps students and teachers to work together, using Windows and Office products. Discover more about this Windows tool!\n\n\nInk Math Assistant\n\nInk math assistant in OneNote is a sort of digital coach that helps students solving their handwritten math problems. This intelligent assistant allows students to directly convert an equation or a problem from screen to text, giving him step-by-step tips to solve it. Here you can watch a short video of how it works.\n\n\nMinecraft Education Edition\n\nThe education platform for learning Minecraft: Education Edition can motivate and inspire every student to achieve more, and ignite a true passion for learning. Minecraft is a game about placing blocks and going on adventures, created by Swedish game designer Markus Persson and released for the first time in 2011 by Mojang AB and Microsoft Studios. Minecraft has many aspects intrinsecally helping students and young people to develop many skills: we already talked about this platform here.\n\n\n\nBuildAWorld\n\nMany studies suggest that playing domestic video games improves visual attention and spatial-motor skills. BuildAWorld is a next generation interactive 3D simulation educational learning platform, designed to engage students with real world scenarios and phenomena. In this article, you can find a demo of this new gaming simulation platform.\n\n\nGoogle AutoDraw\n\nAutoDraw is a new kind of drawing tool, launched by Google in April 2017. It pairs machine learning with drawings from talented artists to help everyone create anything visual, fast. Google Auto Draw is a web app, accessible to the dedicated website, with which you can turn every sketch into a professional design. Test your artistic talent!'),

Students have the chance to learn in a brand new way, helping their teachers to build a new concept of school and exploring new teaching methods. Here are 5 of the most important.\n\n\nOnline learning for accessible education\n\nToday teachers and educators are able to reach a larger audience of students, thanks to online learning. Non-traditional students, such as disabled students who can??t leave their homes or parents and those fully employed, now have access to education thanks to advances in e-learning, no matter what the scheduling issues are.\nThe innovations in the pedagogical strategies applied to online learning made it even more engaging, enhancing the level of interaction and making it seems more and more human. Video communication technology, for example, now allows educators to teach from the comfort of their homes and offices, working more closely together with the student they are assisting in a stress-free condition.\n\n\nThe Internet of Things: power to higher education\n\nThe Internet of Things is one of the most interesting innovations in technology for education, above all for the higher one. Thanks to its introduction, in fact, a whole new world of possibilities emerged changing forever the communication methods between students, professors and schools, improving it. Students can access learning materials when, where and how they want, while teachers work in a more flexible environment.\nThe connectivity between devices and ??everyday things?? allows a powerful data tracking and analytics, providing additional insight into students?? learning process, both in the classroom and on campus or at home. Professors can respond immediately solving critical moments before that learners?? performances begin to suffer.\n\n\nMixed reality: science fiction meets education\n\nMixed Reality (MR) ?V a mix of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) ?V allows students to literally immerse themselves in their learning experience, making them explore also new situations, never lived before because considered too dangerous, expensive, or just impossible (let??s think about the possibility, for example, to visit the Ancient Rome society).\nThanks to MR technologies, children can now walk next to dinosaurs or tigers or take virtual tours of the ancient cities they??re discovering, while, thanks to AR devices, medical students are now able to perform complex procedure without putting their patients at risk.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: a personalized support\n\nThe introduction of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in education means to use big data and machine learning to provide a supplemental, and above all tailor-made, guidance to students. The A.I. tutoring systems are able to monitor learners, analyzing their feedback to create the best path to follow toward the success of their studies.\nA personalized learning experience offered to students produces more productive learning behaviours in themselves, such as self-regulation and self-explanation.\nNot only a tailor-made support, but also new customized educational contents. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, teachers and schools are now able to create their own textbooks and exercises keeping in mind the specific needs of their students. Educators can import their own syllabus and material into content technologies systems which then read and master them, finding new patterns. The algorithms of these systems finally use the gained knowledge to create customized textbooks and classroom materials.\n\n\nComputer games: a safe, positive competition\n\nComputer games used in education can be distinguished in ??serious games?? and ??play and learn games??. The first ones, in particular, act as a highly efficient booster in the teaching, because they do not necessarily seek to entertain students (their primary purpose is learning), introducing two powerful elements: competition and challenge. While in ??real life?? competition can be difficult to manage for the most vulnerable students, in a ??virtual reality?? it becomes amusing and less strenuous, a positive stimulus in a protected environment, which ends when the computer is turned off.\nComputer games are particularly effective in language learning. Students improve their ability to structure sentences and grasp the subtitles of the language they use while they??re playing.'),

No pro version is required to access premium features, no mandatory subscription after a free trial period, nothing at all.\n\n\nThings you can do with Google Classroom\n\nDigital learning improves educators?? ability to communicate, plan and teach, and Google Classroom is one of those advancements that contribute to these progress.\nIf you??ve never used Google Classroom, here you can find a list of things you can do with it.\n\n\nAdd and share announcements and material\n\nWith Google Classroom you can give your students announcements about your lessons, adding learning materials in the announcements. Your students will find everything quickly, without the risk of losing important documents or information. It is simple: you can add any materials from a Google Drive that is connected to the Google Classroom lesson concerned, you can upload files and images, videos from Youtube, and any other link you think could be useful for your students.\n\n\n\nAdd and grade assignments\n\nAfter you added an announcement, you can go on adding an assignment to your course, following the same procedure but with a plus. When you add an assignment, in fact, you can set a due date that will notify your students when they have to make it, and it will also appear in their Google Calendar.\nOnce your students have handed an assignment, you can check it and grade it. Google Classroom offers you the opportunity to use a dedicated ??feedback room??, so you can comment your students?? work and then send the assignment back to them.\n\n\nManage your students\n\nEven your students can have the possibility to share comments and questions, but you will be in charge of managing permissions, giving them the opportunity to post and comment, only comment, or nothing at all.\nIf you want, you can also contact your students individually, through a dedicated email.\n\n\nAdd a co-teacher\n\nIf you??re working with a colleague on the same group of students, you can add a co-teacher to your Google Classroom course. Co-teachers can do anything the teacher can do, but they can??t delete a class. Do you want to have your colleague at your side in Google Classroom? Simply add him through the ??About?? menu and click ??Invite Teachers??.\n\n\n\nKeep parents in the loop\n\nGoogle Classroom offers the ??Invite Guardians?? option, a link next to any student??s name that allows teachers to add his parents (or ??guardians??). Once you added them, they will receive email summaries about learning activities, progress, upcoming work and so on.\n\n\nSimple tips to begin using Google Classroom\n\nGoogle Classroom is a very simple and intuitive solution to exploit the potential of the digital transformation for an educational purpose. If you have decided to start your Google Classroom experience, here you will find some tips to start the journey.\n\n\nSet up you Google Classroom teacher account\n\nGo to classroom.google.com and start using it by logging in with a G Suite email address; if you prefer, you can use it without ??claiming?? to use it for education.\n\n\nCreate your class\n\nChoose ??Create a class?? starting from the ??+?? button you find in the right upper corner. Fill in some detail information about your class, choose a proper name and section, and then click on ??Create??.\n\n\nInvite your students to your class\n\nNow that your class is ready, you can invite your students. Give them the unique code you can find in your created class: they will use it to sign in the Google Classroom app. You can also invite your students one by one by entering their email address. The tab ??Students?? will allow you to manage the students?? list.\n\n\nCreate your assignment (or make an announcement)\n\nGo to the ??Updates?? tab and click on the ??+?? button at the bottom. Always number your assignments so your students will easily understand which one comes first. When you click on the title of an assignment, you will be able to see if any students have handed it, giving grades and feedback.\n\n\nAdd your lesson materials\n\nYou can enrich your assignments by adding some useful lesson material. You can start from your Google Drive account or you can add a YouTube video, a file from your computer, an external link. Choose the function you need clicking beneath the ??due date?? of the assignment.\nStarting from the tab ??About?? you can also share some material which is not linked to an assignment, like a presentation of your class, some slides, any interesting articles, and more.\n\n\nAccess the Drive folder\n\nWhen you create a new class, Google Classroom creates a Drive folder for it. To access these folders, you just need to go to all your class tiles; on each tile you will find a folder icon. Click on it and that??s it! Don??t forget that all your students assignments automatically end up in the Google Drive folder: this simplifies your life, because you will find it back whenever you want!'),

Cloud-based technologies are becoming increasingly essential in students?? routine, both in and out of their classrooms. Thanks to cloud computing, teachers and students are able to better interact and get connected, and they can manage information in a faster and more dynamic way.\nIn this article we will explain you how cloud computing is changing ?V and enhancing ?V education through 5 specific advantages:\n\n\n1. Cloud-classrooms: improving communications and interconnections\n\nCloud computing helps in those situations when students cannot enter a classroom or attend normal classes. Video lessons and chat sessions with the teacher via instant messenger services or video messaging programs allow students to access education even if they are in remote areas of the world, or if they are in critical physical conditions, unable to move from their homes.\nInstant messenger services and video messaging programs are also amazing in the students-to-students communications. Classes from different countries can share their knowledge learning foreign languages or geography. This technology is very simple: teachers just need to set up sessions where students can use technology to talk to each other.\n\n\n2. Cloud-based information means updated education\n\nTextbooks are expensive to print and this means that many of the materials students are using may be outdated.\nCloud-based textbooks are easy to update in real time and allow students to access to the most current learning materials.\n\n\n3. No more textbooks: culture and knowledge accessible to everyone\n\nCloud-based textbooks can also solve the problem of access to culture as the digital content is significantly more affordable than the printed one.\n\n\n4. Group projects become simpler to manage\n\nThanks to cloud-based technologies, students can enjoy their group projects gathering together even if they are in different places. They can communicate and complete tasks by interacting online whenever they want and wherever they are.\nGroup members and teachers can share the results of their work online, adding comments or editing the project in real time, even from different devices like smartphones or tablets.\nCloud-based textbooks help to reach a noble goal by redistributing culture and knowledge as lower-income students can finally have the same access to learning materials as higher-income students.\n\n\n\n5. Storage and accessibility: an unlimited learning\n\nCloud-based computing solves the problem of information storage once and for all thanks to mass storages where schools, teachers and students can upload documents, photos, textbooks and other materials with instant access whenever they need them.\nUsing the cloud-base technology the education system can build an endless storage of learning information with an unlimited potential of usage. Any data stored in a cloud-based system can be accessed from any device provided with an Internet connection.\n\n\nSupport cloud-based technology with smart devices.\n\n\nAcer is leader on Chromebooks thanks to high tech level combined with an affordable price. Find out more reading through or attend BETT in London to experience them live (booth B109)\n\n\nAcer Chromebook 11 N7 (C731)\n\nThe Chromebook 11 N7 (C731) is the ideal choice for schools and school districts that want a reliable, powerful and quiet device for student learning. New Chromebook generation has enhanced durability features and a fan-less design.\n\nStudents can easily stay connected, share and collaborate with each other thanks to Google Drive storage. The Acer Chromebook 11 N7 (C731) is an easy product to deploy and manager for IT administrators as well.\n\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 11 (R751T) with EMR Stylus\n\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 11 (R751T) is a convertible Chromebook with Wacom Electro-Magnetic Resonance Stylus, specialised for classroom use. With Acer new Chromebook Spin 11, students get a ruggedized and easy to use device for learning, while school administrators get a cost-effective laptop package for their schools, helping both students and staff to make the most of what modern technology can deliver.\n\nDesigned with the classroom in mind, The Chromebook Spin 11 (R751T) has a large number of features to facilitate school lessons and activities and enhance their potential. One of the most impressive features is the new 360?X dual-torque hinge design, ensuring an optimized touch experience in the four possible modes:\n\n\n1. Tent mode, ideal for restricted spaces and great for displaying videos or interacting with touchscreen apps\n2. Tablet mode, ideal for mobility and for design projects with the Wacom stylus\n3. Display mode, great for displaying instructional video content or for apps with no touchscreen interaction\n4. Notebook mode, ideal for apps where a full keyboard is needed.');
